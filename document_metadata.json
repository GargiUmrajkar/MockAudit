No implied claims or suggestions of drug use may be made if there is inadequate evidence of safe-ty or a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness.

The National Drug Code number(s) for the drug product must not be included in this section. \n(5) 4 Contraindications. This section \nmust describe any situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use (e.g., certain potentially fatal adverse reactions) clearly out-weighs any possible therapeutic ben-efit. Those situations include use of the drug in patients who, because of their particular age, sex, concomitant ther-apy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by the drug and for whom no potential benefit makes the risk acceptable. Known hazards and not theoretical pos-sibilities must be listed (e.g., if severe hypersensitivity to the drug has not been demonstrated, it should not be listed as a contraindication). If no con-traindications are known, this section must state \u2018\u2018None.\u2019\u2019 \n(6) 5 Warnings and precautions. (i) \nGeneral. This section must describe \nclinically significant adverse reactions (including any that are potentially fatal, are serious even if infrequent, or can be prevented or mitigated through appropriate use of the drug), other po-tential safety hazards (including those that are expected for the pharma-cological class or those resulting from drug/drug interactions), limitations in use imposed by them (e.g., avoiding certain concomitant therapy), and steps that should be taken if they occur (e.g., dosage modification). The frequency of all clinically significant adverse reactions and the approximate mortality and morbidity rates for pa-tients experiencing the reaction, if known and necessary for the safe and effective use of the drug, must be ex-pressed as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. In accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 314.70 and 601.12 of this chapter, the labeling must be revised to include a warning about a clinically significant hazard as soon as there is reasonable evidence of a causal association with a \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n29 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 \ndrug; a causal relationship need not \nhave been definitely established. A spe-cific warning relating to a use not pro-vided for under the \u2018\u2018Indications and Usage\u2019\u2019 section may be required by FDA in accordance with sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the act if the drug is com-monly prescribed for a disease or con-dition and such usage is associated with a clinically significant risk or hazard. \n(ii) Other special care precautions. This \nsection must contain information re-garding any special care to be exer-cised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug (e.g., pre-cautions not required under any other specific section or subsection). \n(iii) Monitoring: Laboratory tests. This \nsection must identify any laboratory tests helpful in following the patient\u2019s response or in identifying possible ad-verse reactions. If appropriate, infor-mation must be provided on such fac-tors as the range of normal and abnor-mal values expected in the particular situation and the recommended fre-quency with which tests should be per-formed before, during, and after ther-apy. \n(iv) Interference with laboratory tests. \nThis section must briefly note informa-tion on any known interference by the product with laboratory tests and ref-erence the section where the detailed information is presented (e.g., \u2018\u2018Drug Interactions\u2019\u2019 section). \n(7) 6 Adverse reactions. This section \nmust describe the overall adverse reac-tion profile of the drug based on the en-tire safety database. For purposes of prescription drug labeling, an adverse reaction is an undesirable effect, rea-sonably associated with use of a drug, that may occur as part of the pharma-cological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. This definition does not include all adverse events observed during use of a drug, only those adverse events for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event. \n(i) Listing of adverse reactions. This \nsection must list the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable. The list or lists must be \npreceded by the information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions (e.g., for clinical trials, total number ex-posed, extent and nature of exposure). \n(ii) Categorization of adverse reactions. \nWithin a listing, adverse reactions must be categorized by body system, by severity of the reaction, or in order of decreasing frequency, or by a com-bination of these, as appropriate. With-in a category, adverse reactions must be listed in decreasing order of fre-quency. If frequency information can-\nnot be reliably determined, adverse re-actions must be listed in decreasing order of severity. \n(A) Clinical trials experience. This sec-\ntion must list the adverse reactions identified in clinical trials that oc-curred at or above a specified rate ap-propriate to the safety database. The rate of occurrence of an adverse reac-tion for the drug and comparators (e.g., placebo) must be presented, unless such data cannot be determined or presen-tation of comparator rates would be misleading. If adverse reactions that occurred below the specified rate are included, they must be included in a separate listing. If comparative rates of occurrence cannot be reliably deter-mined (e.g., adverse reactions were ob-served only in the uncontrolled trial portion of the overall safety database), adverse reactions must be grouped within specified frequency ranges as appropriate to the safety database for the drug (e.g., adverse reactions occur-ring at a rate of less than 1/100, adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 1/500) or descriptively identified, if frequency ranges cannot be deter-mined. For adverse reactions with sig-nificant clinical implications, the list-ings must be supplemented with addi-tional detail about the nature, fre-quency, and severity of the adverse re-action and the relationship of the ad-verse reaction to drug dose and demo-graphic characteristics, if data are available and important. \n(B) Postmarketing experience. This sec-\ntion of the labeling must list the ad-verse reactions, as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, that are identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n30 21 CFR Ch.

For drug products other \nthan biological products, any claim comparing the drug to which the label-ing applies with other drugs in terms of frequency, severity, or character of ad-verse reactions must be based on ade-quate and well-controlled studies as de-fined in \u00a7 314.126(b) of this chapter un-less this requirement is waived under \u00a7 201.58 or \u00a7 314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, any such claim must be based on substantial evidence. \n(8) 7 Drug interactions. (i) This section \nmust contain a description of clinically significant interactions, either ob-served or predicted, with other pre-scription or over-the-counter drugs, classes of drugs, or foods (e.g., dietary supplements, grapefruit juice), and spe-cific practical instructions for pre-venting or managing them. The mecha-nism(s) of the interaction, if known, must be briefly described. Interactions that are described in the \u2018\u2018Contra-indications\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Warnings and Pre-cautions\u2019\u2019 sections must be discussed in more detail under this section. Details of drug interaction pharmacokinetic studies that are included in the \u2018\u2018Clin-ical Pharmacology\u2019\u2019 section that are pertinent to clinical use of the drug must not be repeated in this section. \n(ii) This section must also contain \npractical guidance on known inter-ference of the drug with laboratory tests. \n(9) 8 Use in specific populations. This \nsection must contain the following sub-sections: \n(i) 8.1 Pregnancy. This subsection of \nthe labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the subheadings \u2018\u2018Pregnancy Ex-posure Registry,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Risk Summary,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Clinical Considerations,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Data\u2019\u2019: \n(A) Pregnancy exposure registry. If \nthere is a scientifically acceptable pregnancy exposure registry for the drug, contact information needed to enroll in the registry or to obtain in-formation about the registry must be provided following the statement: \u2018\u2018There is a pregnancy exposure reg-istry that monitors pregnancy out-comes in women exposed to ( name of \ndrug) during pregnancy.\u2019\u2019 (B) Risk summary. The Risk Summary \nmust contain risk statement(s) based on data from all relevant sources (human, animal, and/or pharmacologic) that describe, for the drug, the risk of adverse developmental outcomes ( i.e., \nstructural abnormalities, embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, functional im-pairment, alterations to growth). When multiple data sources are available, the statements must be presented in the following order: Human, animal, pharmacologic. The source(s) of the data must be stated. The labeling must state the percentage range of live births in the United States with a major birth defect and the percentage range of pregnancies in the United States that end in miscarriage, regard-less of drug exposure. If such informa-tion is available for the population(s) for which the drug is labeled, it must also be included. When use of a drug is contraindicated during pregnancy, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary. When applicable, risk statements as described in paragraphs (c)(9)(i)(B)( 1) and ( 2) of this section \nmust include a cross-reference to addi-tional details in the relevant portion of the \u2018\u2018Data\u2019\u2019 subheading in the \u2018\u2018Preg-nancy\u2019\u2019 subsection of the labeling. If data demonstrate that a drug is not systemically absorbed following a par-ticular route of administration, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: \u2018\u2018( Name of drug ) is \nnot absorbed systemically following (route of administration), and mater-nal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug.\u2019\u2019 \n(1) Risk statement based on human \ndata. When human data are available \nthat establish the presence or absence of any adverse developmental out-come(s) associated with maternal use of the drug, the Risk Summary must summarize the specific developmental outcome(s); their incidence; and the ef-fects of dose, duration of exposure, and gestational timing of exposure. If human data indicate that there is an increased risk for a specific adverse de-velopmental outcome in infants born to women exposed to the drug during pregnancy, this risk must be quan-titatively compared to the risk for the same outcome in infants born to women who were not exposed to the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n31 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 \ndrug but who have the disease or condi-\ntion for which the drug is indicated to be used. When risk information is not available for women with the disease or condition for which the drug is indi-cated, the risk for the specific outcome must be compared to the rate at which the outcome occurs in the general pop-ulation. The Risk Summary must state when there are no human data or when available human data do not establish the presence or absence of drug-associ-ated risk. \n(2) Risk statement based on animal \ndata. When animal data are available, \nthe Risk Summary must summarize the findings in animals and based on these findings, describe, for the drug, the potential risk of any adverse devel-opmental outcome(s) in humans. This statement must include: The number and type(s) of species affected, timing of exposure, animal doses expressed in terms of human dose or exposure equivalents, and outcomes for pregnant animals and offspring. When animal studies do not meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies, the Risk Summary must so state. When there are no animal data, the Risk Summary must so state. \n(3) Risk statement based on pharma-\ncology. When the drug has a well-under-\nstood mechanism of action that may result in adverse developmental out-come(s), the Risk Summary must ex-plain the mechanism of action and the potential associated risks. \n(C) Clinical considerations. Under the \nsubheading \u2018\u2018Clinical Considerations,\u2019\u2019 the labeling must provide relevant in-formation, to the extent it is available, under the headings \u2018\u2018Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Maternal adverse reactions,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Labor or de-livery\u2019\u2019: \n(1) Disease-associated maternal and/or \nembryo/fetal risk. If there is a serious \nknown or potential risk to the preg-nant woman and/or the embryo/fetus associated with the disease or condi-tion for which the drug is indicated to be used, the labeling must describe the risk. \n(2) Dose adjustments during pregnancy \nand the postpartum period. If there are pharmacokinetic data that support \ndose adjustment(s) during pregnancy and the postpartum period, a summary of this information must be provided. \n(3) Maternal adverse reactions. If use of \nthe drug is associated with a maternal adverse reaction that is unique to preg-nancy or if a known adverse reaction occurs with increased frequency or se-verity in pregnant women, the labeling must describe the adverse reaction and available intervention(s) for moni-toring or mitigating the reaction.

This information includes de-tailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-docu-mented studies obtained from a lit-erature search. Controlled studies in-clude those that are part of the mar-keting application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug applica-tion, new drug application, biologics li-cense application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applica-tions (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The \u2018\u2018Geriatric use\u2019\u2019 subsection must con-tain the following statement(s) or rea-sonable alternative, as applicable, tak-ing into account available information: \n(1) If clinical studies did not include \nsufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the \u2018\u2018Geriatric use\u2019\u2019 subsection must include the following statement: \nClinical studies of ( name of drug ) did \nnot include sufficient numbers of sub-jects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clin-ical experience has not identified dif-ferences in responses between the el-derly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, re-flecting the greater frequency of de-creased hepatic, renal, or cardiac func-tion, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. (2) If clinical studies (including stud-\nies that are part of marketing applica-tions and other relevant studies avail-able to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor\u2019s applica-tions) included enough elderly subjects to make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in safety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the \u2018\u2018Geriatric use\u2019\u2019 subsection must con-tain the following statement: \nOf the total number of subjects in clinical \nstudies of ( name of drug ), __ percent were 65 \nand over, while __ percent were 75 and over. \n(Alternatively, the labeling may state the total number of subjects included in the studies who were 65 and over and 75 and over.) No overall differences in safety or ef-fectiveness were observed between these sub-jects and younger subjects, and other re-ported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. \n(3) If evidence from clinical studies \nand other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific moni-toring or dosage adjustment, the \u2018\u2018Geriatric use\u2019\u2019 subsection must con-tain a brief description of observed dif-ferences or specific monitoring or dos-age requirements and, as appropriate, must refer to more detailed discussions in the \u2018\u2018Contraindications,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Warnings and Precautions,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Dosage and Admin-istration,\u2019\u2019 or other sections. \n(C)(1) If specific pharmacokinetic or \npharmacodynamic studies have been \ncarried out in the elderly, they must be described briefly in the \u2018\u2018Geriatric use\u2019\u2019 subsection and in detail under the \u2018\u2018Clinical Pharmacology\u2019\u2019 section.

If a specific important clinical study is mentioned in any section of the labeling required under \u00a7\u00a7 201.56 and 201.57 because the study is essential to an understandable presentation of the information in that section of the la-beling, any detailed discussion of the study must appear in this section. \n(i) For drug products other than bio-\nlogical products, any clinical study that is discussed in prescription drug labeling that relates to an indication for or use of the drug must be adequate and well-controlled as described in \u00a7 314.126(b) of this chapter and must not imply or suggest indications or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the \u2018\u2018In-dications and Usage\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Dosage and Administration\u2019\u2019 section. For biologi-cal products, any clinical study that is discussed that relates to an indication for or use of the biological product must constitute or contribute to sub-stantial evidence and must not imply or suggest indications or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the \u2018\u2018Indications and Usage\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Dosage and Adminis-tration\u2019\u2019 section. \n(ii) Any discussion of a clinical study \nthat relates to a risk from the use of the drug must also refer to the other sections of the labeling where the risk is identified or discussed. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n39 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 \n(16) 15 References. When prescription \ndrug labeling must summarize or oth-erwise rely on a recommendation by an authoritative scientific body, or on a standardized methodology, scale, or technique, because the information is important to prescribing decisions, the labeling may include a reference to the source of the information. \n(17) 16 How supplied/storage and han-\ndling. This section must contain infor-\nmation on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is responsible. The information must include, as appropriate: \n(i) The strength or potency of the \ndosage form in metric system (e.g., 10 milligram tablets) and, if the apothe-cary system is used, a statement of the strength in parentheses after the met-ric designation; \n(ii) The units in which the dosage \nform is ordinarily available for pre-scribing by practitioners (e.g., bottles of 100); \n(iii) Appropriate information to fa-\ncilitate identification of the dosage forms, such as shape, color, coating, scoring, imprinting, and National Drug Code number; and \n(iv) Special handling and storage \nconditions. \n(18) 17 Patient counseling information. \nThis section must contain information necessary for patients to use the drug safely and effectively (e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects).

Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not included in this section. \n(ii) For biological products, all indi-\ncations listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of ef-fectiveness. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not included in this section. \n(3) This section of the labeling shall \nalso contain the following additional information: \n(i) If evidence is available to support \nthe safety and effectiveness of the drug only in selected subgroups of the larger population with a disease, syndrome, or symptom under consideration, e.g., patients with mild disease or patients in a special age group, the labeling shall describe the available evidence and state the limitations of usefulness of the drug. The labeling shall also identify specific tests needed for selec-tion or monitoring of the patients who need the drug, e.g., microbe suscepti-bility tests. Information on the approx-imate kind, degree, and duration of im-provement to be anticipated shall be stated if available and shall be based on substantial evidence derived from adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in \u00a7 314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under \u00a7 201.58 or \u00a7 314.126(c) of this chapter.

(ii) If safety considerations are such \nthat the drug should be reserved for certain situations, e.g., cases refrac-tory to other drugs, this information shall be stated in this section. \n(iii) If there are specific conditions \nthat should be met before the drug is used on a long-term basis, e.g., dem-onstration of responsiveness to the drug in a short-term trial, the labeling shall identify the conditions; or, if the indications for long-term use are dif-ferent from those for short-term use, the labeling shall identify the specific indications for each use. \n(iv) If there is a common belief that \nthe drug may be effective for a certain use or if there is a common use of the drug for a condition, but the prepon-derance of evidence related to the use or condition shows that the drug is in-effective, the Food and Drug Adminis-tration may require that the labeling state that there is a lack of evidence that the drug is effective for that use or condition. \n(v) Any statements comparing the \nsafety or effectiveness, either greater or less, of the drug with other agents for the same indication shall be sup-ported by adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in \u00a7 314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under \u00a7 201.58 or \u00a7 314.126(c) of this chapter. \n(d) Contraindications. Under this sec-\ntion heading, the labeling shall de-scribe those situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use clearly outweighs any pos-sible benefit. These situations include administration of the drug to patients known to have a hypersensitivity to it; use of the drug in patients who, be-cause of their particular age, sex, con-comitant therapy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by it; or contin-ued use of the drug in the face of an un-acceptably hazardous adverse reaction.

The labeling shall be re-vised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an asso-ciation of a serious hazard with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been proved. A specific warning relat-ing to a use not provided for under the \u2018\u2018Indications and Usage\u2019\u2019 section of the labeling may be required by the Food and Drug Administration if the drug is commonly prescribed for a disease or condition, and there is lack of substan-tial evidence of effectivenes for that disease or condition, and such usage is associated with serious risk or hazard. Special problems, particularly those that may lead to death or serious in-jury, may be required by the Food and Drug Administration to be placed in a prominently displayed box. The boxed warning ordinarily shall be based on clinical data, but serious animal tox-icity may also be the basis of a boxed warning in the absence of clinical data. If a boxed warning is required, its loca-tion will be specified by the Food and Drug Administration. The frequency of these serious adverse reactions and, if known, the approximate mortality and morbidity rates for patients sustaining the reaction, which are important to safe and effective use of the drug, shall be expressed as provided under the \u2018\u2018Adverse Reactions\u2019\u2019 section of the la-beling. \n(f) Precautions. Under this section \nheading, the labeling shall contain the following subsections as appropriate for the drug: \n(1) General. This subsection of the la-\nbeling shall contain information re-garding any special care to be exer-cised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug, e.g., pre-cautions not required under any other specific section or subsection of the la-beling. \n(2) Information for patients. This sub-\nsection must contain information nec-essary for patients to use the drug safe-ly and effectively (e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects). Any FDA-ap-proved patient labeling must be ref-erenced in this section and the full text of such patient labeling must be re-\nprinted immediately following the last section of labeling or, alternatively, accompany the prescription drug label-ing. The type size requirement for the Medication Guide set forth in \u00a7 208.20 of this chapter does not apply to the Medication Guide that is reprinted in or accompanying the prescription drug labeling unless such Medication Guide is to be detached and distributed to pa-tients in compliance with \u00a7 208.24 of this chapter. \n(3) Laboratory tests. This subsection of \nthe labeling shall identify any labora-tory tests that may be helpful in fol-lowing the patient\u2019s response or in identifying possible adverse reactions. If appropriate, information shall be provided on such factors as the range of normal and abnormal values ex-pected in the particular situation and the recommended frequency with which tests should be done before, dur-ing, and after therapy. \n(4)(i) Drug interactions. This sub-\nsection of the labeling shall contain specific practical guidance for the phy-sician on preventing clinically signifi-cant drug/drug and drug/food inter-actions that may occur in vivo in pa-tients taking the drug. Specific drugs or classes of drugs with which the drug to which the labeling applies may interact in vivo shall be identified, and the mechanism(s) of the interaction shall be briefly described. Information in this subsection of the labeling shall be limited to that pertaining to clin-ical use of the drug in patients. Drug interactions supported only by animal or in vitro experiments may not ordi-narily be included, but animal or in vitro data may be used if shown to be clinically relevant. Drug incompati-bilities, i.e., drug interactions that may occur when drugs are mixed in vitro, as in a solution for intravenous administration, shall be discussed under the \u2018\u2018Dosage and Administra-tion\u2019\u2019 section of the labeling rather than under this subsection of the label-ing. \n(ii) Drug/laboratory test interactions. \nThis subsection of the labeling shall contain practical guidance on known interference of the drug with labora-tory tests. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n60 21 CFR Ch.

For all other drugs, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following in-formation: \n(i) Teratogenic effects. Under this \nheading the labeling shall identify one of the following categories that applies to the drug, and the labeling shall bear the statement required under the cat-egory: \n(a) If adequate and well-controlled \nstudies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: \u2018\u2018Studies in pregnant women have not shown that ( name of drug ) increases the \nrisk of fetal abnormalities if adminis-tered during the first ( second, third, or \nall) trimester( s) of pregnancy.

In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the dis-ease and the effects of the drug, both beneficial and adverse, are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult popu-lations to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric pa-tients. The additional information sup-porting pediatric use must ordinarily include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of appropriate dos-age. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in the pediatric population, data from other studies supporting the safe-ty or effectiveness of the drug in pedi-atric patients, pertinent premarketing or postmarketing studies or experi-ence, may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and effec-tively in pediatric patients. When a drug is approved for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with other information sup-porting pediatric use, the \u2018\u2018Pediatric use\u2019\u2019 subsection of the labeling shall contain either the following statement, or a reasonable alternative: \u2018\u2018The safe-ty and effectiveness of ( drug name ) have \nbeen established in the age groups _ to \n_ (note any limitations, e.g., no data \nfor pediatric patients under 2, or only applicable to certain indications ap-proved in adults).

Specific tables or monographs may be included to clarify dosage schedules. Radiation dosimetry information shall be stated for both the patient receiving a radio-active drug and the person admin-istering it. This section shall also con-tain specific direction on dilution, preparation (including the strength of the final dosage solution, when pre-pared according to instructions, in terms of milligrams active ingredient per milliliter of reconstituted solution, unless another measure of the strength is more appropriate), and administra-tion of the dosage form, if needed, e.g., the rate of administration of paren-teral drug in milligrams per minute; storage conditions for stability of the drug or reconstituted drug, when im-portant; essential information on drug incompatibilities if the drug is mixed in vitro with other drugs; and the fol-lowing statement for parenterals: \u2018\u2018Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate mat-ter and discoloration prior to adminis-tration, whenever solution and con-tainer permit.\u2019\u2019 \n(k) How Supplied. This section of the \nlabeling shall contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is respon-sible. The information shall ordinarily include: \n(1) The strength of the dosage form, \ne.g., 10-milligram tablets, in metric system and, if the apothecary system is used, a statement of the strength is \nplaced in parentheses after the metric designation; \n(2) The units in which the dosage \nform is ordinarily available for pre-scribing by practitioners, e.g., bottles of 100; \n(3) Appropriate information to facili-\ntate identification of the dosage forms, such as shape, color, coating, scoring, and National Drug Code; and \n(4) Special handling and storage con-\nditions. \n(l) Animal Pharmacology and/or Animal \nToxicology. In most cases, the labeling \nneed not include this section. Signifi-cant animal data necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans shall ordinarily be included in one or more of the other sections of the label-ing, as appropriate. Commonly for a drug that has been marketed for a long time, and in rare cases for a new drug, chronic animal toxicity studies have not been performed or completed for a drug that is administered over pro-longed periods or is implanted in the body. The unavailability of such data shall be stated in the appropriate sec-tion of the labeling for the drug. If the pertinent animal data cannot be appro-priately incorporated into other sec-tions of the labeling, this section may be used. \n(m) \u2018\u2018Clinical Studies\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Ref-\nerences\u2019\u2019.

Labeling and other promotional claims have been evaluated as \u2018\u2018effective,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018probably effective,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018possibly effec-tive,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018ineffective,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018ineffective as a fixed combination,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018effective but,\u2019\u2019 and a report for each drug in the study has been submitted to the Com-missioner. \n(2) The Food and Drug Administra-\ntion is processing the reports, seeking voluntary action on the part of the drug manufacturers and distributors in the elimination or modification of un-supported promotional claims, and ini-tiating administrative actions as nec-essary to require product and labeling changes. \n(3) Delays have been encountered in \nbringing to the attention of the pre-scribers of prescription items the con-clusions of the expert panels that re-viewed the promotional claims. \n(b) The Commissioner of Food and \nDrugs concludes that: \n(1) The failure to disclose in the la-\nbeling of a drug and in other pro-motional material the conclusions of the Academy experts that a claim is \u2018\u2018ineffective,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018possibly effective,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018probably effective,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018ineffective as a fixed combination,\u2019\u2019 while labeling and promotional material bearing any such claim are being used, is a failure to disclose facts that are material in \nlight of the representations made and causes the drug to be misbranded. \n(2) The Academy classification of a \ndrug as other than \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019 for a claim for which such drug is rec-ommended establishes that there is a material weight of opinion among qualified experts contrary to the rep-resentation made or suggested in the labeling, and failure to reveal this fact causes such labeling to be misleading. \n(c) Therefore, after publication in the \nF\nEDERAL REGISTER of a Drug Efficacy \nStudy Implementation notice on a pre-scription drug, unless exempted or oth-erwise provided for in the notice, all package labeling (other than the im-mediate container or carton label, un-less such labeling contains information required by \u00a7 201.100(c)(1) in lieu of a package insert), promotional labeling, and advertisements shall include, as part of the information for practi-tioners under which the drug can be safely and effectively used, an appro-priate qualification of all claims evalu-ated as other than \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019 by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences\u2014National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, if such claims continue to be included in ei-ther the labeling or advertisements. However, this qualifying information will be required in advertisements only if promotional material is included therein for claims evaluated as less than \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019 or if such claims are included in the indications section of the portion of the advertisement con-taining the information required in brief summary by \u00a7 202.1(e)(1) of this chapter. When, however, the Food and Drug Administration classification of such claim is \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019 (for example, on the basis of revision of the language of the claim or submission or existence of adequate data), such qualification is not necessary. When the Food and Drug Administration classification of the claim, as stated in the implementation notice, differs from that of the Acad-emy but is other than \u2018\u2018effective,\u2019\u2019 the qualifying statement shall refer to this classification in lieu of the Academy\u2019s classification. \n(d) For new drugs and antibiotics, \nsupplements to provide for revised la-beling in accord with paragraph (c) of \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n77 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.200 \nthis section shall be submitted under \nthe provisions of \u00a7 314.70 and \u00a7 514.8 of this chapter within 90 days after publi-cation of the implementation notice in the F\nEDERAL REGISTER or by May 15, \n1972, for those drugs for which notices have been published and such labeling shall be put into use as soon as possible but not later than the end of the time period allowed for submitting supple-ments to provide for revised labeling. \n(e) Qualifying information required \nin drug labeling by paragraph (c) of this section in order to advise pre-scribers of a drug of the findings made by a panel of the Academy in evalu-ating a claim as other than \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019 shall be at least of the same size and color and degree of prominence as other printing in the labeling and shall be presented in a prominent box using one of the following formats and proce-dures: \n(1) In drug labeling the box state-\nment may entirely replace the indica-tions section and be in the following format: \nINDICATIONS  \nBased on a review of this drug by the Na-\ntional Academy of Sciences\u2014National Re-search Council and/or other information, FDA has classified the indication(s) as fol-lows: \nEffective: ( list or state in paragraph form ). \n\u2018\u2018Probably\u2019\u2019 effective: ( list or state in para-\ngraph form ). \n\u2018\u2018Possibly\u2019\u2019 effective: ( list or state in para-\ngraph form ). \nFinal classification of the less-than-effec-\ntive indications requires further investiga-tion. \n(2) Or the indication(s) for which the \ndrug has been found effective may ap-pear outside the boxed statement and be followed immediately by the fol-lowing boxed statement: \nBased on a review of this drug by the \nNational Academy of Sciences\u2014Na-tional Research Council and/or other information, FDA has classified the other indication(s) as follows: \n\u2018\u2018Probably\u2019\u2019 effective: ( list or state in \nparagraph form ). \n\u2018\u2018Possibly\u2019\u2019 effective: ( list or state in \nparagraph form ). \nFinal classification of the less-than- \neffective indications requires further investigation.

Numerous preparations of such inert glandular materials were subsequently marketed with disclaimers of the type suggested. The term inert glandular ma-\nterials means preparations incapable of \nexerting an action or effect of some significant or measurable benefit in one way or another, i.e., in the diag-nosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or in affecting the structure or any function of the body. (b) Manufacturers have heretofore \ntaken advantage of \u00a7 201.100 permitting omission of directions for use when the label bears the prescription legend. Section 201.100(c) requires that the la-beling of the drug, which may include brochures readily available to licensed practitioners, bear information as to the use of the drug by practitioners li-censed by law to administer it. Obvi-ously, information adequate for the use of an inert glandular preparation is not available to practitioners licensed by law. \n(c) The Department of Health and \nHuman Services is of the opinion that inert glandular materials may not be exempted from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the act that they bear adequate directions for use; and, accordingly, that their labeling must include among other things, represen-tations as to the conditions for which such articles are intended to be used or as to the structure or function of the human body that they are intended to affect. Since any such representations offering these articles for use as drugs would be false or misleading, such arti-cles will be considered to be mis-branded if they are distributed for use as drugs. \n(d) The amended regulations provide \nalso that in the case of drugs intended for parenteral administration there shall be no exemption from the require-ment that their labelings bear ade-quate directions for use. Such inert glandular materials for parenteral use are therefore subject to the same com-ment as applies to those intended for oral administration.

There is no international unit for measuring the activity of estradiol and no accepted relationship between its activity and that of estrone, either in test animals or in humans. The dec-laration of potency of estradiol in terms of international units or in terms of international units of estrone activity is therefore considered mis-leading, within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 352(a).

These studies have indicated that when min-eral oil is used orally near mealtime it interferes with absorption from the di-gestive tract of provitamin A and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K, and consequently interferes with the utili-zation of calcium and phosphorus, with the result that the user is left liable to deficiency diseases.

The cause of this paradoxical \nreaction is unknown; it has been ob-served, however, that patients have not responded completely to other forms of therapy until use of the isoproterenol inhalation preparation was discon-tinued. In addition, sudden unexpected deaths have been associated with the excessive use of isoproterenol inhala-tion preparations.

These small-bowel lesions have caused obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation. Surgery was frequently required and deaths have occurred.

So-dium phosphates oral solution has been marketed in 45-milliliter (mL), 90-mL, and 240-mL container sizes. The 45-mL \nand 90-mL container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution are often rec-ommended and prescribed by physi-cians for bowel cleansing prior to sur-gery and diagnostic procedures of the colon. Sodium phosphates oral solution (adult dose 20 mL to 45 mL) is also used as an over-the-counter (OTC) laxative for the relief of occasional constipa-tion. Accidental overdosing and deaths have occurred because the 240-mL con-tainer was mistakenly used instead of the 45-mL or 90-mL container. The Food and Drug Administration is lim-iting the amount of sodium phosphates oral solution to not more than 90 mL (3 ounces (oz)) per OTC container because of the serious health risks associated with the ingestion of larger than in-tended doses of this product. Further, because an overdose of either oral or rectal enema sodium phosphates can cause an electrolyte imbalance, addi-tional warning and direction state-ments are required for the safe use of any OTC laxative drug product con-taining sodium phosphates. \n(b) Any OTC drug product for lax-\native or bowel cleansing use containing sodium phosphates as an active ingre-dient when marketed as described in paragraph (a) of this section is mis-branded within the meaning of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act unless packaged and labeled as follows: \n(1) Package size limitation for so-\ndium phosphates oral solution: Con-tainer shall not contain more than 90 mL (3 oz). \n(2) Warnings.

In the emergency treatment of these poisonings, ipecac syrup is considered the emetic of choice. The immediate availability of \nthis drug for use in such situations is critical, since rapid treatment may be the difference between life and death. The restriction of this drug to prescrip-tion sale limits its availability in emergencies. On the other hand, it is the consensus of informed medical opinion that ipecac syrup should be used only under medical supervision in the emergency treatment of poisonings. In view of these facts, the question of whether ipecac syrup la-beled as an emergency treatment for use in poisonings should be available over the counter has been controver-sial. \n(b) In connection with its study of \nthis problem, the Food and Drug Ad-ministration has obtained the views of medical authorities. It is the unani-mous recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the American Medical Association, and the Medical Advisory Board of the Food and Drug Administration that ip-ecac syrup in 1 fluid ounce containers be permitted to be sold without pre-scription so that it will be readily available in the household for emer-gency treatment of poisonings, under medical supervision, and that the drug be appropriately packaged and labeled for this purpose. \n(c) In view of the above recommenda-\ntions, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that it is in the interest of the public health for ipecac syrup to be available for sale without prescription, provided that it is pack-aged in a quantity of 1 fluid ounce (30 milliliters), and its label bears, in addi-tion to other required label informa-tion, the following, in a prominent and conspicuous manner: \n(1) A statement conspicuously boxed \nand in red letters, to the effect: \u2018\u2018For emergency use to cause vomiting in poisoning.

This study led to the decision that there was probable cause to conclude that misuse and pro-longed use of the drug were in fact re-sponsible for kidney lesions and dis-ease. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in December 1963, appointed an ad hoc Advisory Committee of Inquiry on Possible Nephrotoxicity Associated With the Abuse of Acetophenetidin (Phenacetin)-Containing Preparations. This committee, composed of scientists in the fields of pharmacology and med-icine, on April 23, 1964, submitted its findings and conclusions in the matter and recommended that all acetophe-netidin (phenacetin)-containing prep-arations bear a warning as provided in section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \n(b) On the basis of the studies made \nby the Food and Drug Administration and the report of the Advisory Com-mittee, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is nec-essary for the protection of users that the label and labeling of all acetophe-netidin (phenacetin)-containing prep-arations bear a warning statement to the following effect: \u2018\u2018Warning\u2014This medication may damage the kidneys when used in large amounts or for a long period of time.

These effects may increase the risk of transmission of the AIDS virus (HIV) from an in-fected partner. Therefore, consumers should be warned that these products do not protect against the trans-mission of the AIDS virus (HIV) or other STDs, that use of these products can increase vaginal and rectal irrita-tion, which may increase the risk of getting the AIDS virus (HIV) from an HIV infected partner, and that the products are not for rectal use.

The delivered dose to the UV exposure site must be within 10 percent of the expected dose. \n(iv) Periodic measurement. To ensure \nthat the solar simulator delivers the appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, the emission spectrum of the solar sim-ulator should be measured at least an-nually with an appropriate and accu-rately calibrated spectroradiometer system (results should be traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Technology). In addition, the solar simulator must be recalibrated if there is any change in the lamp bulb or the optical filtering components ( i.e., fil-\nters, mirrors, lenses, collimating de-vices, or focusing devices). Daily solar simulator radiation intensity should be monitored with a broadband radiom-eter with a response weighted to match the erythema action spectrum in ISO 17166 CIE S 007/E entitled \u2018\u2018Erythemal reference action spectrum and standard erythema dose,\u2019\u2019 which is incorporated by reference in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. If a lamp must be replaced due to failure or aging during a phototest, broadband device readings consistent with those obtained for the original calibrated lamp will suffice until measurements can be performed with the spectroradiometer at the ear-liest possible opportunity. \n(2) SPF standard \u2014(i) Preparation.

A suitable source of low power UVA, such as a Woods lamp, is helpful in this process. If any of these condi-tions are present, the subject is not qualified to participate in the study. The presence of nevi, blemishes, or moles will be acceptable if, in the phy-sician\u2019s judgment, they will neither compromise the study nor jeopardize a subject\u2019s safety. Subjects with dysplastic nevi should not be enrolled. Excess hair on the back is acceptable if the hair is clipped. Shaving is unac-ceptable because it may remove a sig-nificant portion of the stratum corneum and temporarily alter the skin\u2019s response to UV radiation. \n(iv) Informed consent. Obtain legally \neffective written informed consent from all test subjects. \n(4) Sunscreen application. (i) Test site. \nTest sites are locations on each sub-ject\u2019s back, between the beltline and the shoulder blades (scapulae) and lat-eral to the midline, where skin re-sponses to UV radiation are deter-mined. Responses on unprotected skin (no test material applied) and pro-tected skin (sunscreen test product(s) or SPF standard applied) are deter-mined at separate unprotected and pro-tected test sites, respectively. Test sites should be randomly located in a blinded manner. Each test site should be a minimum of 30 square centimeters and outlined with indelible ink. \n(ii) Test subsite. Test subsites are the \nlocations to which UV radiation is ad-ministered within a test site. At least five test subsites should receive UV doses within each test site. Test subsites should be at least 0.5 square centimeters (cm\n2) in area and should be \nseparated from each other by at least 0.8 cm. Each test subsite should be out-lined with indelible ink. \n(iii) Applying test materials. Apply the \nsunscreen test product and the SPF standard at 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm\n2) to their respective \ntest sites. Use a finger cot compatible with the sunscreen to spread the prod-uct as evenly as possible. \n(iv) Waiting period. Wait at least 15 \nminutes after applying a sunscreen product before exposing the test sites to UV radiation as described in para-\ngraph (i)(5)) of this section. For water resistant sunscreen products, proceed with the water resistance testing pro-cedure described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section after waiting at least 15 minutes. \n(5) UV exposure \u2014(i) Definition of mini-\nmal erythema dose (MED). The minimal \nerythema dose (MED) is the smallest UV dose that produces perceptible red-ness of the skin (erythema) with clear-ly defined borders at 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The MED for unpro-tected skin (MED\nu) is determined on a \ntest site that does not have sunscreen applied. The MED for protected skin (MED\np) is determined on a test site \nthat has sunscreen applied. An MED pis \ndetermined for the SPF standard (ssMED\np).

In \norder that the person who evaluates the test subsites is not biased, he/she should not be the same person who ap-plied the sunscreen drug product to the test site or administered the UV doses. After UV doses are administered, all immediate responses should be re-corded. These may include an imme-diate darkening or tanning, typically grayish or purplish in color, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes; an immediate reddening at the subsite, due to heat-ing of the skin, which fades rapidly; and an immediate generalized heat re-sponse, spreading beyond the subsite, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes. After the immediate responses are noted, each subject should shield the exposed area from further UV radiation until the MED is determined. Determine the MED 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. Because erythema is evaluated 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure, the final MED\nu, ssMED p, and tpMED pare typi-\ncally determined the day following de-termination of the initial MED\nu. Evalu-\nate the erythema responses of each test subsite using either tungsten or warm \nwhite fluorescent lighting that pro-vides at least 450 lux of illumination at the test site. For the evaluation, the test subject should be in the same posi-tion as when the test site was irradi-ated. \n(v) Invalid test data. Reject test data \nfor a test subject if erythema is not present on either the unprotected or protected test sites; or erythema is present at all subsites; or the responses are inconsistent with the series of UV doses administered; or the subject was noncompliant (e.g., the subject with-draws from the test due to illness or work conflicts or does not shield the exposed testing sites from further UV radiation until the MED is deter-mined). \n(6) Determination of SPF. (i) Calculate \nan SPF value for each test subject (SPF\ni) as follows: \n(ii) Calculate the mean \nand the standard deviation (s) from the \nSPF ivalues. Calculate the standard \nerror (SE), which equals s/ \u221an (where n \nequals the number of subjects who pro-vided valid test results). Obtain the t value from Student\u2019s t distribution table corresponding to the upper 5-per-cent point with n\u20141 degrees of free-dom. Determine the labeled SPF value, which equals the largest whole number less than \nIn order for the SPF determination of a test product to be considered valid, the SPF value of the SPF standard should fall within the standard devi-ation range of the expected SPF ( i.e., \n16.3 \u00b13.43). \n(7) Determination of water resistance. \nThe following procedure should be per-formed in an indoor fresh water pool, whirlpool, and/or hot tub maintained at 23 to 32 \u00b0C. Fresh water is clean \ndrinking water that meets the stand-ards in 40 CFR part 141. The pool and air temperature and the relative hu-midity should be recorded. \n(i) Water resistance (40 minutes).

(i) Plate. Use optical- \ngrade polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates suitable for UV trans-mittance measurements. The plate should be roughened on one side to a three dimensional surface topography measure (Sa) between 2 and 7 microm-eters and must have a rectangular ap-plication area of at least 16 square cen-timeters (with no side shorter than 4 cm). \n(ii) Sample holder.

The plate should be roughened on one side to a three dimensional surface topography measure (Sa) between 2 and 7 microm-eters and must have a rectangular ap-plication area of at least 16 square cen-timeters (with no side shorter than 4 cm). \n(ii) Sample holder. The sample holder \nshould hold the PMMA plate in a hori-zontal position to avoid flowing of the sunscreen drug product from one edge of the PMMA plate to the other. It should be mounted as close as possible to the input optics of the spectrometer to maximize capture of forward scat-tered radiation. The sample holder should be a thin, flat plate with a suit-able aperture through which UV radi-ation can pass. The PMMA plate should be placed on the upper surface of the sample holder with the roughened side facing up. \n(iii) Light source. The light source \nshould produce a continuous spectral distribution of UV radiation from 290 to 400 nanometers. \n(iv) Input optics. Unless the spectrom-\neter is equipped with an integrating sphere, an ultraviolet radiation dif-fuser should be placed between the sample and the input optics of the spectrometer. The diffuser will be con-structed from any UV radiation trans-parent material (e.g., Teflon\n\u00aeor quartz). The diffuser ensures that the \nradiation received by the spectrometer is not collimated. The spectrometer input slits should be set to provide a bandwidth that is less than or equal to 1 nanometer. \n(v) Dynamic range of the spectrometer. \nThe dynamic range of the spectrometer should be sufficient to measure trans-mittance accurately through a highly absorbing sunscreen product at all ter-restrial solar UV wavelengths (290 to 400 nm). \n(2) Sunscreen product application to \nPMMA plate. The accuracy of the test \ndepends upon the application of a pre-cisely controlled amount of sunscreen product with a uniform distribution over the PMMA plate. The product is applied at 0.75 mg per square centi-meter to the roughened side of the PMMA plate. The sunscreen product should be applied in a series of small dots over the entire PMMA plate and then spread evenly using a gloved fin-ger. Spreading should be done with a very light spreading action for approxi-mately 30 seconds followed by spread-ing with greater pressure for approxi-mately 30 seconds. The plate should then be allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes in the dark before the pre-irra-diation described in paragraph (c) of this section. \n(3) Sunscreen product pre-irradiation. \nTo account for lack of photostability, apply the sunscreen product to the PMMA plate as described in paragraph (b) of this section and then irradiate with a solar simulator described in sec-tion 352.70(b) of this chapter. The irra-diation dose should be 4 MEDs which is equivalent to an erythemal effective dose of 800 J/m\n2(i.e., 800 J/m2-eff). \n(4) Calculation of mean transmittance \nvalues. After pre-irradiation described \nin paragraph (c) of this section, mean transmittance values should be deter-mined for each wavelength \u03bb over the \nfull UV spectrum (290 to 400 nano-meters). The transmittance values should be measured at 1 nanometer in-tervals. Measurements of spectral irra-diance transmitted for each wave-length \u03bb through control PMMA plates \ncoated with 15 microliters of glycerin (no sunscreen product) should be ob-tained from at least 5 different loca-tions on the PMMA plate [C1( \u03bb), C2( \u03bb), \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n103 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.328 \nC3(\u03bb), C4( \u03bb), and C5( \u03bb)]. In addition, a \nminimum of 5 measurements of spec-tral irradiance transmitted for each wavelength \u03bb through the PMMA plate \ncovered with the sunscreen product will be similarly obtained after pre-ir-radiation of the sunscreen product [P1( \u03bb), P2( \u03bb), P3( \u03bb), P4( \u03bb), and P5( \u03bb)]. \nThe mean transmittance for each \nwavelength, \nis the ratio of the mean of the C( \u03bb) val-\nues to the mean of the P( \u03bb) values, as \nfollows: \nWhere n \u22655 \n(5) Calculation of mean absorbance val-\nues. (i) Mean transmittance values, \nare converted into mean absorbance \nvalues, \nat each wavelength by taking the nega-tive logarithm of the mean transmit-tance value as follows: \n(ii) The calculation yields 111 \nmonochromatic absorbance values in 1 nanometer increments from 290 to 400 nanometers. \n(6) Number of plates. For each sun-\nscreen product, mean absorbance val-ues should be determined from at least three individual PMMA plates. Because paragraph (d) of this section requires at least 5 measurements per plate, there should be a total of at least 15 measurements. \n(7) Calculation of the critical wave-\nlength. The critical wavelength is iden-\ntified as the wavelength at which the integral of the spectral absorbance \ncurve reaches 90 percent of the integral over the UV spectrum from 290 to 400 nm. The following equation defines the critical wavelength: \nWhere \u03bbc = critical wavelength \nA(\u03bb) = mean absorbance at each wavelength \nd\u03bb = wavelength interval between measure-\nments \nA mean critical wavelength of 370 nm \nor greater is classified as broad spec-trum protection. \n[76 FR 35660, June 17, 2011, as amended at 76 \nFR 38975, July 5, 2011] ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/201.pdf", "part_title": "LABELING", "subpart_title": "Specific Labeling Re-", "section": "\u00a7 201.327(i)(1)(ii) of this section."}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 201.328 Labeling of medical gas con-\ntainers. \n(a) Portable cryogenic medical gas con-\ntainers.

(i) The requirement of a true statement of information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness applies to the entire advertisement. Untrue or misleading information in any part of the advertisement will not be corrected by the inclusion in an-other distinct part of the advertise-ment of a brief statement containing true information relating to side ef-fects, contraindications, and effective-ness of the drug. If any part or theme of the advertisement would make the advertisement false or misleading by reason of the omission of appropriate qualification or pertinent information, that part or theme shall include the appropriate qualification or pertinent information, which may be concise if it is supplemented by a prominent ref-erence on each page to the presence and location elsewhere in the adver-tisement of a more complete discussion of such qualification or information. \n(ii) The information relating to effec-\ntiveness is not required to include in-formation relating to all purposes for which the drug is intended but may op-tionally be limited to a true statement of the effectiveness of the drug for the selected purpose(s) for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the ad-vertisement. The information relating to effectiveness shall include specific indications for use of the drug for pur-poses claimed in the advertisement; for example, when an advertisement con-tains a broad claim that a drug is an antibacterial agent, the advertisement shall name a type or types of infections and microorganisms for which the drug is effective clinically as specifically as required, approved, or permitted in the drug package labeling. \n(iii) The information relating to side \neffects and contraindications shall dis-close each specific side effect and con-traindication (which include side ef-fects, warnings, precautions, and con-traindications and include any such in-formation under such headings as cau-tions, special considerations, impor-tant notes, etc.; see paragraph (e)(1) of this section) contained in required, ap-proved, or permitted labeling for the advertised drug dosage form(s): Pro-\nvided, however, (a) The side effects and contraindica-\ntions disclosed may be limited to those pertinent to the indications for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement to the extent that such limited disclosure has previously \nbeen approved or permitted in drug la-beling conforming to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 201.100 or 201.105; and \n(b) The use of a single term for a \ngroup of side effects and contraindica-tions (for example, \u2018\u2018blood dyscrasias\u2019\u2019 for disclosure of \u2018\u2018leukopenia,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018agranulocytosis,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018neutropenia\u2019\u2019) is permitted only to the extent that the use of such a single term in place of disclosure of each specific side effect and contraindication has been pre-viously approved or permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 201.100 or 201.105. \n(4) Substance of information to be in-\ncluded in brief summary.

The Food and Drug Ad-\nministration has the authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to establish a uniform na-tional requirement for tamper-evident packaging of OTC drug products that \nwill improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products. An OTC drug product (except a der-matological, dentifrice, insulin, or loz-enge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant pack-age or that is not properly labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of the act, or both. \n(b) Requirements for tamper-evident \npackage. (1) Each manufacturer and \npacker who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, den-tifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this prod-uct is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident pack-age is one having one or more indica-tors or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has oc-curred. To reduce the likelihood of suc-cessful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinc-tive by design or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying char-acteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, reg-istered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term \u2018\u2018distinctive by design\u2019\u2019 means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and closure system or secondary-container or car-\nton system or any combination of sys-tems intended to provide a visual indi-cation of package integrity. The tam-per-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manu-facture, distribution, and retail dis-play. \n(2) In addition to the tamper-evident \npackaging feature described in para-graph (b)(1) of this section, any two- piece, hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an ac-ceptable tamper-evident technology. \n(c) Labeling. (1) In order to alert con-\nsumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules, containers of compressed medical oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is re-quired to bear a statement that: \n(i) Identifies all tamper-evident fea-\nture(s) and any capsule sealing tech-nologies used to comply with para-graph (b) of this section; \n(ii) Is prominently placed on the \npackage; and \n(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaf-\nfected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing. \n(2) If the tamper-evident feature cho-\nsen to meet the requirements in para-graph (b) of this section uses an identi-fying characteristic, that char-acteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For exam-\nple, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say \u2018\u2018For your protection, this bottle has an im-printed seal around the neck.\u2019\u2019 \n(d) Request for exemptions from pack-\naging and labeling requirements. A man-\nufacturer or packer may request an ex-emption from the packaging and label-ing requirements of this section. A re-quest for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under \u00a7 10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a \u2018\u2018Request for Exemption from the Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.\u2019\u2019 The petition is required to con-tain the following: \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00179 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n170 21 CFR Ch.

Changes in packaging and labeling re-quired by this regulation may be made before FDA approval, as provided under \u00a7 314.70(c) of this chapter.

In particular, neither clin-ical investigations nor clinical experi-ence justify any representations that such drugs are effective in the manage-ment of hypertension; in the manage-ment of coronary insufficiency or coro-nary artery disease, except for their anginal manifestations; or in the man-agement of the post coronary state, ex-cept angina pectoris present after coro-\nnary occlusion and myocardial infarc-tion. \n(c) Any preparation containing such \ndrugs that is labeled or advertised for any use other than management of an-gina pectoris, or that is represented to be efficacious for any other purpose by reason of its containing such drug, will be regarded by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration as misbranded and subject to regulatory proceedings, unless such recommendations are covered by the approval of a new-drug application based on a showing of safety and effec-tiveness. \n(d) Any such drug in long-acting dos-\nage form is regarded as a new drug that requires an approved new-drug applica-tion before marketing. \n(e) Any of the drugs listed in para-\ngraph (a)(2) of this section is regarded as a new drug that requires an ap-proved new-drug application.

It is therefore the view of the Food and Drug Administration that gelsemium is not a proper ingredient in any prod-uct that is to be sold without prescrip-tion. Accordingly, any drug containing gelsemium will be regarded as mis-branded under section 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if its label fails to bear in a prominent and conspicuous fashion the statement \u2018\u2018Rx only.\u2019\u2019 \n[40 FR 14033, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 67 \nFR 4906, Feb. 1, 2002] \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00214 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n205 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 250.108 \n\u00a7\u00a7 250.106\u2013250.107 [Reserved] ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/250.pdf", "part_title": "SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC HUMAN DRUGS", "subpart_title": "New Drug or Prescrip-", "section": "\u00a7 250.102 Drug preparations intended"}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 250.108 Potassium permanganate\npreparations as prescription drugs. \n(a) There have been a number of re-\nports in the medical literature of seri-ous injuries to women resulting from the misuse of potassium permanganate in an effort to induce abortion. Reports from physicians who have treated such cases show that the injuries are com-monly caused by introducing tablets or crystals of potassium permanganate into the vagina. Experience with these cases shows that such use of potassium permanganate is not effective in pro-ducing abortion, but that instead the drug produces serious and painful in-jury to the walls of the vagina, causing ulcers, massive hemorrhage, and infec-tion. Such dangerous and useless em-ployment of potassium permanganate is apparently encouraged among the misinformed by the mistaken idea that the vaginal bleeding caused by the cor-rosive action of the drug indicates a termination of pregnancy, which it does not. \n(b) Potassium permanganate is a \nstrong oxidizing agent, a highly caus-tic, tissue-destroying chemical, and a poison. There are no circumstances under which crystals and tablets of po-tassium permanganate constitute safe dosage forms for use in self-medica-tion. It is the consensus of informed medical opinion that the only dosage forms of potassium permanganate known to be safe for use in self-medica-tion are aqueous solutions containing not more than 0.04 percent potassium permanganate. Such solutions are safe for use in self-medication only by ex-ternal application to the skin. \n(c) In view of the very real poten-\ntiality for harmful effect, and the ac-tual injuries caused by the misuse of potassium permanganate, the Food and Drug Administration believes that in order adequately to protect the public health: \n(1) Potassium permanganate and po-\ntassium permanganate tablets intended for human use are drugs subject to sec-tion 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and should be restricted to prescription sale.

It clearly presents the following facts: \n(1) The Sixteenth Revision of the \nPharmacopeia of the United States, which became official on October 1, 1960, does not include preparations in-tended for the treatment of pernicious anemia by oral administration. \n(2) The U.S.P. unit for anti-anemia \npreparations no longer has any signifi-cance. \n(3) The U.S.P. Anti-anemia Prepara-\ntions Advisory Board was disbanded. \n(b) On the basis of the scientific evi-\ndence and conclusions summarized in the statement of the U.S.P. Anti-ane-mia Preparations Advisory Board as well as pertinent information from other sources, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds it is the con-sensus of well informed medical opin-ion that: \n(1) The parenteral administration of \ncyanocobalamin or vitamin B\n12is gen-\nerally recognized as a fully effective treatment of pernicious anemia. Paren-teral cyanocobalamin preparations have not been and are not authorized for use except by or on the prescription of a duly licensed medical practitioner. \n(2) Some patients afflicted with per-\nnicious anemia do not respond to oral-ly ingested products. There is no known way to predict which patients will fail to respond or will cease to re-spond to the treatment of pernicious \nanemia with orally ingested prepara-tions. \n(3) The substitution of a possibly in-\nadequate treatment, such as the inges-tion of oral preparations of vitamin B\n12 \nwith intrinsic factor concentrate, in place of parenteral vitamin B\n12prod-\nucts for a disease condition as serious as pernicious anemia cannot be re-\ngarded as safe in all cases. \n(4) The development of the classical \nsymptoms of pernicious anemia that would cause a person to seek medical attention may in some cases be delayed by oral ingestion of intrinsic factor. Pernicious anemia is a disease that is associated, among other things, with a higher than normal incidence of cancer of the stomach and that for the safety of the patient, requires continuous ex-pert medical supervision. \n(5) With inadequate treatment there \nmay be markedly deleterious effects on the nervous system. It is well estab-lished that whereas the development of anemia is completely reversible with adequate treatment, the involvement of the nervous system may not be com-pletely reversible and thus may result in permanent damage. \n(6) Some hematologists prescribe oral \npreparations of vitamin B\n12in the \ntreatment of pernicious-anemia pa-tients. \n(7) Intrinsic factor and intrinsic fac-\ntor concentrate serve no known useful therapeutic or nutritive purpose except to the extent that they do increase the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin \nB\n12in patients with a deficiency or ab-\nsence of intrinsic factor, which may eventually lead to pernicious anemia. This conclusion does not apply to diag-nostic procedures using radioactive cyanocobalamin. \n(8) Medical expertise is required for \nthe diagnosis as well as the manage-ment of pernicious anemia. \n(c) The Eleventh Edition of The Na-\ntional Formulary and its first Interim Revision include monographs for oral preparations of vitamin B\n12with in-\ntrinsic factor concentrate, establish a unit of vitamin B\n12with intrinsic fac-\ntor concentrate, and provide for a Na-tional Formulary Anti-anemia Prep-arations Advisory Board to assign the potency of such preparations. This pro-vides for the availability of such oral preparations, standardized within the meaning of the broad limits char-acteristic of the evaluation of such preparations. \n(d) Any drug that is offered for or \npurports to contain intrinsic factor or \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00216 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n207 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 250.250 \nintrinsic factor concentrate will be re-\ngarded as misbranded within the mean-ing of section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless it is labeled with the statement \u2018\u2018Rx only.\u2019\u2019 \n(e) Any drug for oral ingestion in-\ntended, represented, or advertised for the prevention or treatment of per-nicious anemia or which purports to contain any substance or mixture of substances described in paragraph (d) of this section (other than diagnostic drugs containing radioactive cyano-cobalamin) will be regarded as mis-branded under sections 502 (f)(2) and (j) of the act unless its labeling bears a statement to the effect that some pa-tients afflicted with pernicious anemia may not respond to the orally ingested product and that there is no known way to predict which patients will re-spond or which patients may cease to respond to the orally ingested prod-ucts. The labeling shall also bear a statement that periodic examinations and laboratory studies of pernicious anemia patients are essential and rec-ommended. \n(f) Under section 409 of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, intrin-sic factor and intrinsic factor con-centrate are regarded as food additives. No food additive regulation nor exist-ing extension of the effective date of section 409 of the act authorizes these additives in foods, including foods for special dietary uses.

The use of \nhexachlorophene as an antibacterial component in drug and cosmetic prod-ucts has expanded widely in recent years. It is used in such products be-cause of its bacteriostatic action against gram-positive organisms, espe-cially against strains of staphy-lococcus; however, hexachlorophene of-fers no protection against gram-nega-tive infections. In addition the anti-bacterial activity depends largely on repeated use. A notice published in the F\nEDERAL REGISTER of April 4, 1972 (37 \nFR 6775), invited data on OTC anti-microbial ingredients, including hexachlorophene, for review by an OTC Drug Advisory Review Panel to be con-vened under the procedures set forth in the F\nEDERAL REGISTER of May 11, 1972 \n(37 FR 9464). This statement of policy will remain in effect unless and until replaced by a monograph resulting from the OTC Drug Advisory Review \nPanel. \n(b) Adverse effects. Though considered \nsafe for many years, recent informa-tion has become available associating hexachlorophene with toxic effects, in-cluding deaths. Studies have shown that toxic amounts of hexachlorophene can be absorbed through the skin of hu-mans, especially the skin of premature babies or damaged skin. Human tox-icity reports include data on symp-tomatology, blood and tissue levels of hexachlorophene, and descriptions of neuropathologic lesions. Recent infant deaths due to use of baby powder acci-dentally contaminated with 6 percent hexachlorophene have occurred. The accumulated evidence of toxicity is sufficient to require that continued marketing of hexachlorophene con-taining products be carefully defined in order to protect consumers. \n(c) Prescription drugs.

In the interest of public health protection, hexachlorophene containing drugs will \nbe regarded as misbranded and subject to regulatory proceedings unless the label bears the statement \u2018\u2018Rx only,\u2019\u2019 and the labeling on or within the pack-age from which the drug is to be dis-pensed bears adequate information for its safe and effective use by practi-tioners, in accord with \u00a7 201.100(c) of this chapter. \n(2) The Food and Drug Administra-\ntion recognizes that hexachlorophene is useful as a bacteriostatic skin cleanser. It further concludes that the margin of safety is such that products containing hexachlorophene may ap-propriately be used within clearly de-lineated conditions of use. \n(3) In order for such drugs to bear \nadequate information for safe and ef-fective use the following statements are representative of the type of label-ing for products shown to be effective bacteriostatic skin cleansers. Labeling for products other than bacteriostatic skin cleansers will be determined through the new drug procedures based on the available data. \n(i) In the labeling other than on the \nimmediate container label. \nINDICATIONS  \n1. Bacteriostatic skin cleanser for surgical \nscrubbing or handwashing as part of patient care. \n2. For topical application to control an \noutbreak of gram-positive infection where other infection control procedures have been unsuccessful. Use only as long as necessary for infection control. \nC\nONTRAINDICATIONS  \n1. Not for use on burned or denuded skin or \non mucous membranes. \n2. Not for routine prophylactic total body \nbathing. \nWARNINGS  \nRinse thoroughly after use. Patients \nshould be closely monitored and use should be immediately discontinued at the first sign of any of the symptoms described below. \nHexachlorophene is rapidly absorbed and \nmay produce toxic blood levels when applied to skin lesions such as ichthyosis congenita or the dermatitis of Letterer-Siwe\u2019s syn-\ndrome or other generalized dermatologic conditions. Application to burns has also produced neurotoxicity and death. \nInfants have developed dermatitis, irrita-\nbility, generalized clonic muscular contrac-tions and decerebrate rigidity following ap-plication of a 6 percent hexachlorophene powder. Examination of brainstems of those infants revealed vacuolization like that which can be produced in newborn experi-mental animals following repeated topical application of 3 percent hexachlorophene. Moreover, a study of histologic sections of premature infants who died of unrelated causes has shown a positive correlation be-tween hexachlorophene baths and lesions in white matter of brains. \n(ii) On the immediate container label \nprominently displayed and in bold print: \n\u2018\u2018Special Warning: This compound may be \ntoxic if used other than as directed. Rinse thoroughly after use. Monitor patients close-ly for toxicity symptoms.\u2019\u2019 \n(4) Marketing of products for the in-\ndications listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section may be continued without an approved new drug application (or \nrequired supplement thereto) either until a notice of opportunity for hear-ing is issued on a proposal by the Di-rector of the Center for Drug Evalua-tion and Research to refuse to approve such new drug application (or required supplement) or until January 31, 1978, whichever comes first, if all the fol-lowing conditions were met after Sep-tember 27, 1972: \n(i) The product is labeled with the \nstatement \u2018\u2018Rx only\u2019\u2019 and adequate in-formation for safe and effective use as set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this sec-tion. \n(ii) Within 30 days, or by (10\u201327\u201372) \nthe holder of an approved new drug ap-plication submits a supplement to pro-vide for the revised label and full dis-closure labeling.

(1) The SIP Sponsor \nmust establish a procedure to track the public announcements of the manufac-turer of each drug it imports under sec-tion 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the SIP Sponsor must also monitor FDA\u2019s recall website for recall or market with-drawal information relevant to the drugs that it imports under section 804. \n(2) If FDA, the SIP Sponsor, the For-\neign Seller, the Importer, or the manu-facturer determines that a recall is \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 09:47 Aug 26, 2024 Jkt 262074 PO 00000 Frm 00242 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262074.XXX 262074skersey on DSK4WB1RN3PROD with CFR\n233 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 251.19 \nwarranted, the SIP Sponsor must effec-\ntuate the recall in accordance with its written recall plan under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. \n(3) A SIP must have a written recall \nplan that describes the procedures to perform a recall of the product and specifies who will be responsible for performing the procedures. The recall plan must cover recalls mandated or requested by FDA and recalls initiated by the SIP Sponsor, the Foreign Seller, the Importer, or the manufacturer. The recall plan must include sufficient pro-cedures for the SIP Sponsor to: \n(i) Immediately cease distribution of \nthe drugs affected by the recall; \n(ii) Directly notify consignees of the \ndrug(s) included in the recall, including how to return or dispose of the recalled drugs; \n(iii) Specify the depth to which the \nrecall will extend (e.g., wholesale, in-termediate wholesale, retail or con-sumer level) if not specified by FDA; \n(iv) Notify the public about any haz-\nard(s) presented by the recalled drug when appropriate to protect the public health; \n(v) Conduct effectiveness checks to \nverify that all consignees at the speci-fied recall depth have received notifica-tion about the recall and have taken appropriate action; \n(vi) Appropriately dispose of recalled \nproduct; and \n(vii) Notify FDA of the recall. (4) In the event of a recall, the Im-\nporter must, upon request by FDA, pro-vide transaction history, information, and statement (as these terms are de-fined in sections 581(25), 581(26), and 581(27) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act), in accordance with ap-plicable requirements under sections 582(c)(1)(C) and 582(d)(1)(D). \n(i) The Importer must also provide to \nFDA, upon request, information given by the manufacturer under \u00a7 251.14(a)(6), including transaction doc-uments that were provided from the manufacturer to the Foreign Seller. \n(ii) The Foreign Seller must provide \nto FDA, upon request, information about its transactions of the recalled drug with the manufacturer and the Importer. \n(5) The Foreign Seller and Importer \nmust cooperate with any recalls, in-cluding recalls initiated by the SIP \nSponsor, FDA, the Foreign Seller, the Importer, or the drug\u2019s manufacturer.

Section 502(e) of the act (as amended by said Drug Amendments) prescribes that the labeling of a drug must bear its estab-lished name, if there is one, to the ex-clusion of any other nonproprietary name (except the applicable systematic chemical name or the chemical for-mula) and, if the drug is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the es-tablished name of each active ingre-dient. \n(b) The term established name is de-\nfined in section 502(e)(3) of the act as (1) an official name designated pursu-ant to section 508 of the act; (2) if no such official name has been designated for the drug and the drug is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium; and (3) if neither para-graphs (b) (1) or (2) of this section ap-plies, then the common or usual name of the drug. \n(c) The Food and Drug Administra-\ntion recognizes the skill and experience of the U.S. Adopted Names Council (USAN) in deriving names for drugs. \nThe U.S. Adopted Names Council is a private organization sponsored by the American Medical Association, the United States Pharmacopeia, and the American Pharmaceutical Association, and has been engaged in the assign-ment of names to drugs since January 1964. The Council negotiates with man-ufacturing firms in the selection of nonproprietary names for drugs. \n(d) The Food and Drug Administra-\ntion cooperates with and is represented on the USAN Council.

A sponsor \nwho wishes to charge for its investiga-tional drug, including investigational use of its approved drug, must: \n(i) Provide evidence that the drug has \na potential clinical benefit that, if demonstrated in the clinical investiga-tions, would provide a significant ad-vantage over available products in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of a disease or condition; \n(ii) Demonstrate that the data to be \nobtained from the clinical trial would be essential to establishing that the drug is effective or safe for the purpose of obtaining initial approval of a drug, or would support a significant change in the labeling of an approved drug (e.g., new indication, inclusion of com-parative safety information); and \n(iii) Demonstrate that the clinical \ntrial could not be conducted without charging because the cost of the drug is extraordinary to the sponsor. The cost may be extraordinary due to manufac-turing complexity, scarcity of a nat-ural resource, the large quantity of drug needed (e.g., due to the size or du-ration of the trial), or some combina-tion of these or other extraordinary circumstances (e.g., resources available to a sponsor). \n(2) Duration of charging in a clinical \ntrial.

A sponsor may re-quest that FDA reauthorize charging for additional periods. \n(d) Costs recoverable when charging for \nan investigational drug. (1) A sponsor \nmay recover only the direct costs of making its investigational drug avail-able. \n(i) Direct costs are costs incurred by \na sponsor that can be specifically and exclusively attributed to providing the drug for the investigational use for which FDA has authorized cost recov-ery. Direct costs include costs per unit to manufacture the drug (e.g., raw ma-terials, labor, and nonreusable supplies and equipment used to manufacture the quantity of drug needed for the use for which charging is authorized) or costs to acquire the drug from another manufacturing source, and direct costs to ship and handle (e.g., store) the drug. \n(ii) Indirect costs include costs in-\ncurred primarily to produce the drug for commercial sale (e.g., costs for fa-cilities and equipment used to manu-facture the supply of investigational drug, but that are primarily intended to produce large quantities of drug for eventual commercial sale) and research and development, administrative, labor, or other costs that would be in-curred even if the clinical trial or treatment use for which charging is au-thorized did not occur. \n(2) For expanded access to an inves-\ntigational drug for treatment use under \u00a7\u00a7 312.315 (intermediate-size pa-tient populations) and 312.320 (treat-ment IND or treatment protocol), in addition to the direct costs described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, a \nsponsor may recover the costs of moni-toring the expanded access IND or pro-tocol, complying with IND reporting requirements, and other administrative costs directly associated with the ex-panded access IND. \n(3) To support its calculation for cost \nrecovery, a sponsor must provide sup-porting documentation to show that the calculation is consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and, if applicable, (d)(2) of this section. The documentation must be accompanied by a statement that an independent certified public accountant has re-viewed and approved the calculations. \n[74 FR 40899, Aug. 13, 2009] ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/312.pdf", "part_title": "INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION", "subpart_title": "General Provisions", "section": "\u00a7 312.8 Charging for investigational"}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 312.10 Waivers.\n(a) A sponsor may request FDA to \nwaive applicable requirement under this part.

The clinical investigation of a previously untested drug is generally divided into three phases. Although in general the phases are conducted sequentially, they may overlap. These three phases of an investigation are a follows: \n(a) Phase 1. (1) Phase 1 includes the \ninitial introduction of an investiga-tional new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These stud-ies are designed to determine the me-tabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects as-sociated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on ef-fectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug\u2019s phar-macokinetics and pharmacological ef-fects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. The total num-ber of subjects and patients included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. (2) Phase 1 studies also include stud-\nies of drug metabolism, structure-ac-tivity relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. \n(b) Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the con-\ntrolled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indica-tions in patients with the disease or condition under study and to deter-mine the common short-term side ef-fects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and con-ducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. \n(c) Phase 3. Phase 3 studies are ex-\npanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after pre-liminary evidence suggesting effective-ness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.

(Reprints of published articles on such studies may be appended when useful.) \n(v) A description of possible risks and \nside effects to be anticipated on the basis of prior experience with the drug under investigation or with related drugs, and of precautions or special monitoring to be done as part of the in-vestigational use of the drug. \n(6) Protocols. (i) A protocol for each \nplanned study. (Protocols for studies not submitted initially in the IND should be submitted in accordance with \u00a7 312.30(a).) In general, protocols for Phase 1 studies may be less detailed and more flexible than protocols for Phase 2 and 3 studies. Phase 1 protocols should be directed primarily at pro-viding an outline of the investigation\u2014 an estimate of the number of patients to be involved, a description of safety exclusions, and a description of the dosing plan including duration, dose, or method to be used in determining dose\u2014and should specify in detail only those elements of the study that are critical to safety, such as necessary monitoring of vital signs and blood chemistries. Modifications of the ex-perimental design of Phase 1 studies that do not affect critical safety as-sessments are required to be reported to FDA only in the annual report. \n(ii) In Phases 2 and 3, detailed proto-\ncols describing all aspects of the study should be submitted. A protocol for a Phase 2 or 3 investigation should be de-signed in such a way that, if the spon-sor anticipates that some deviation from the study design may become nec-essary as the investigation progresses, alternatives or contingencies to pro-vide for such deviation are built into the protocols at the outset. For exam-ple, a protocol for a controlled short- term study might include a plan for an \nearly crossover of nonresponders to an alternative therapy. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n61 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 312.23 \n(iii) A protocol is required to contain \nthe following, with the specific ele-ments and detail of the protocol re-flecting the above distinctions depend-ing on the phase of study: \n(a) A statement of the objectives and \npurpose of the study. \n(b) The name and address and a state-\nment of the qualifications (curriculum vitae or other statement of qualifica-tions) of each investigator, and the name of each subinvestigator (e.g., re-search fellow, resident) working under the supervision of the investigator; the name and address of the research fa-cilities to be used; and the name and address of each reviewing Institutional Review Board. \n(c) The criteria for patient selection \nand for exclusion of patients and an es-timate of the number of patients to be studied. \n(d) A description of the design of the \nstudy, including the kind of control group to be used, if any, and a descrip-tion of methods to be used to minimize bias on the part of subjects, investiga-tors, and analysts. \n(e) The method for determining the \ndose(s) to be administered, the planned maximum dosage, and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug. \n(f) A description of the observations \nand measurements to be made to fulfill the objectives of the study. \n(g) A description of clinical proce-", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/312.pdf", "part_title": "INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION", "subpart_title": "Investigational New", "section": "\u00a7 312.23 IND content and format."}}, {"page_content": " descrip-tion of methods to be used to minimize bias on the part of subjects, investiga-tors, and analysts. \n(e) The method for determining the \ndose(s) to be administered, the planned maximum dosage, and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug. \n(f) A description of the observations \nand measurements to be made to fulfill the objectives of the study. \n(g) A description of clinical proce-\ndures, laboratory tests, or other meas-ures to be taken to monitor the effects of the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk. \n(7) Chemistry, manufacturing, and con-\ntrol information. (i) As appropriate for \nthe particular investigations covered by the IND, a section describing the composition, manufacture, and control of the drug substance and the drug product. Although in each phase of the investigation sufficient information is required to be submitted to assure the proper identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug, the amount of information need-ed to make that assurance will vary with the phase of the investigation, the proposed duration of the investigation, the dosage form, and the amount of in-formation otherwise available. FDA recognizes that modifications to the method of preparation of the new drug \nsubstance and dosage form and changes in the dosage form itself are likely as the investigation progresses. There-fore, the emphasis in an initial Phase 1 submission should generally be placed on the identification and control of the raw materials and the new drug sub-stance. Final specifications for the drug substance and drug product are not expected until the end of the inves-tigational process. \n(ii) It should be emphasized that the \namount of information to be submitted depends upon the scope of the proposed clinical investigation. For example, al-though stability data are required in all phases of the IND to demonstrate that the new drug substance and drug product are within acceptable chemical and physical limits for the planned du-ration of the proposed clinical inves-tigation, if very short-term tests are proposed, the supporting stability data can be correspondingly limited. \n(iii) As drug development proceeds \nand as the scale or production is changed from the pilot-scale produc-tion appropriate for the limited initial clinical investigations to the larger- scale production needed for expanded clinical trials, the sponsor should sub-mit information amendments to sup-plement the initial information sub-mitted on the chemistry, manufac-turing, and control processes with in-formation appropriate to the expanded scope of the investigation. \n(iv) Reflecting the distinctions de-\nscribed in this paragraph (a)(7), and based on the phase(s) to be studied, the submission is required to contain the following: \n(a) Drug substance. A description of \nthe drug substance, including its phys-ical, chemical, or biological character-istics; the name and address of its man-ufacturer; the general method of prepa-ration of the drug substance; the ac-\nceptable limits and analytical methods used to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug sub-stance; and information sufficient to support stability of the drug substance during the toxicological studies and the planned clinical studies.

Adequate information about \npharmacological and toxicological studies of the drug involving labora-tory animals or in vitro, on the basis of which the sponsor has concluded that it is reasonably safe to conduct the proposed clinical investigations. The kind, duration, and scope of animal and other tests required varies with the du-ration and nature of the proposed clin-ical investigations. Guidance docu-ments are available from FDA that de-scribe ways in which these require-ments may be met. Such information is required to include the identification and qualifications of the individuals who evaluated the results of such stud-\nies and concluded that it is reasonably safe to begin the proposed investiga-tions and a statement of where the in-vestigations were conducted and where the records are available for inspec-tion.

The following defini-\ntions of terms apply to this section: \nAdverse event means any untoward \nmedical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. \nLife-threatening adverse event or life- \nthreatening suspected adverse reaction. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered \u2018\u2018life-threat-ening\u2019\u2019 if, in the view of either the in-vestigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at imme-diate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. \nSerious adverse event or serious sus-\npected adverse reaction.

Exam-ples of such medical events include al-lergic bronchospasm requiring inten-sive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convul-sions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \nSuspected adverse reaction means any \nadverse event for which there is a rea-sonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the pur-poses of IND safety reporting, \u2018\u2018reason-able possibility\u2019\u2019 means there is evi-dence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction im-plies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. \nUnexpected adverse event or unexpected \nsuspected adverse reaction. An adverse \nevent or suspected adverse reaction is considered \u2018\u2018unexpected\u2019\u2019 if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an inves-tigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the gen-eral investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, he-patic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the inves-tigator brochure referred only to ele-vated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unex-pected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. \u2018\u2018Unex-pected,\u2019\u2019 as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occur-ring with a class of drugs or as antici-pated from the pharmacological prop-erties of the drug, but are not specifi-cally mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. \n(b) Review of safety information. The \nsponsor must promptly review all in-formation relevant to the safety of the \ndrug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from foreign or domestic sources, including information derived from any clinical or epidemiological investigations, animal or in vitro stud-ies, reports in the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers, as well as reports from foreign regulatory authorities and reports of foreign com-mercial marketing experience for drugs that are not marketed in the United States. \n(c)(1) IND safety reports. The sponsor \nmust notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investiga-tor\u2019s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor deter-mines that the information qualifies for reporting under paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iii), or (c)(1)(iv) of this section. In each IND safety report, the sponsor must identify all IND safety reports previously submitted to FDA concerning a similar suspected adverse reaction, and must analyze the signifi-cance of the suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, similar reports or any other relevant information. \n(i) Serious and unexpected suspected \nadverse reaction. The sponsor must re-\nport any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as: \n(A) A single occurrence of an event \nthat is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Ste-vens-Johnson Syndrome); \n(B) One or more occurrences of an \nevent that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture); \n(C) An aggregate analysis of specific \nevents observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the under-lying disease or condition under inves-tigation or other events that com-monly occur in the study population \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n67 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 312.32 \nindependent of drug therapy) that indi-\ncates those events occur more fre-quently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical con-trol group. \n(ii) Findings from other studies. The \nsponsor must report any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled anal-ysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies (other than those reported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this sec-tion), whether or not conducted under an IND, and whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a signifi-cant risk in humans exposed to the drug. Ordinarily, such a finding would result in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, investi-gator brochure (excluding routine up-dates of these documents), or other as-pects of the overall conduct of the clin-ical investigation. \n(iii) Findings from animal or in vitro \ntesting. The sponsor must report any \nfindings from animal or in vitro test-ing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity, or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure. Ordinarily, any such findings would re-sult in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, investi-gator brochure (excluding routine up-dates of these documents), or other as-pects of the overall conduct of the clin-ical investigation. \n(iv) Increased rate of occurrence of seri-\nous suspected adverse reactions. The \nsponsor must report any clinically im-portant increase in the rate of a seri-ous suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investi-gator brochure. \n(v) Submission of IND safety reports. \nThe sponsor must submit each IND safety report in a narrative format or on FDA Form 3500A or in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. FDA will periodically issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, prep-aration and organization of files). The sponsor may submit foreign suspected adverse reactions on a Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) I Form instead of a \nFDA Form 3500A. Reports of overall findings or pooled analyses from pub-lished and unpublished in vitro, ani-mal, epidemiological, or clinical stud-ies must be submitted in a narrative format.

Upon request from FDA, the sponsor must submit to FDA any addi-tional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after receiving the re-quest. \n(2) Unexpected fatal or life-threatening \nsuspected adverse reaction reports. The \nsponsor must also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 cal-endar days after the sponsor\u2019s initial receipt of the information. \n(3) Reporting format or frequency. FDA \nmay require a sponsor to submit IND safety reports in a format or at a fre-quency different than that required under this paragraph. The sponsor may also propose and adopt a different re-porting format or frequency if the change is agreed to in advance by the director of the FDA review division that has responsibility for review of the IND. \n(4) Investigations of marketed drugs. A \nsponsor of a clinical study of a drug marketed or approved in the United States that is conducted under an IND is required to submit IND safety re-ports for suspected adverse reactions that are observed in the clinical study, at domestic or foreign study sites. The sponsor must also submit safety infor-mation from the clinical study as pre-scribed by the postmarketing safety re-porting requirements (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 310.305, 314.80, and 600.80 of this chapter). \n(5) Reporting study endpoints. Study \nendpoints (e.g., mortality or major morbidity) must be reported to FDA by the sponsor as described in the protocol and ordinarily would not be reported under paragraph (c) of this section. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n68 21 CFR Ch.

A clinical hold is an order \nissued by FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. The clinical hold order may apply to one or more of the investigations covered by an IND. When a proposed study is placed on clinical hold, subjects may not be given the investigational drug. When an ongoing study is placed on clinical hold, no new subjects may be recruited to the study and placed on the investigational drug; patients al-ready in the study should be taken off therapy involving the investigational drug unless specifically permitted by \nFDA in the interest of patient safety. \n(b) Grounds for imposition of clinical \nhold\u2014(1) Clinical hold of a Phase 1 study \nunder an IND. FDA may place a pro-\nposed or ongoing Phase 1 investigation on clinical hold if it finds that: \n(i) Human subjects are or would be \nexposed to an unreasonable and signifi-cant risk of illness or injury; \n(ii) The clinical investigators named \nin the IND are not qualified by reason of their scientific training and experi-ence to conduct the investigation de-scribed in the IND; \n(iii) The investigator brochure is \nmisleading, erroneous, or materially incomplete; or \n(iv) The IND does not contain suffi-\ncient information required under \u00a7 312.23 to assess the risks to subjects of the proposed studies. \n(v) The IND is for the study of an in-\nvestigational drug intended to treat a life-threatening disease or condition that affects both genders, and men or women with reproductive potential who have the disease or condition being studied are excluded from eligi-bility because of a risk or potential risk from use of the investigational drug of reproductive toxicity ( i.e., af-\nfecting reproductive organs) or devel-opmental toxicity ( i.e., affecting poten-\ntial offspring). The phrase \u2018\u2018women with reproductive potential\u2019\u2019 does not include pregnant women. For purposes of this paragraph, \u2018\u2018life-threatening ill-nesses or diseases\u2019\u2019 are defined as \u2018\u2018dis-eases or conditions where the likeli-hood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted.\u2019\u2019 The clin-ical hold would not apply under this \nparagraph to clinical studies con-ducted: \n(A) Under special circumstances, \nsuch as studies pertinent only to one gender (e.g., studies evaluating the ex-cretion of a drug in semen or the ef-fects on menstrual function); \n(B) Only in men or women, as long as \na study that does not exclude members of the other gender with reproductive potential is being conducted concur-rently, has been conducted, or will take place within a reasonable time agreed upon by the agency; or \n(C) Only in subjects who do not suffer \nfrom the disease or condition for which the drug is being studied. \n(2) Clinical hold of a Phase 2 or 3 study \nunder an IND. FDA may place a pro-\nposed or ongoing Phase 2 or 3 inves-tigation on clinical hold if it finds that: \n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\ngraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(v) of this section apply; or \n(ii) The plan or protocol for the in-\nvestigation is clearly deficient in de-sign to meet its stated objectives. \n(3) Clinical hold of an expanded access \nIND or expanded access protocol. FDA \nmay place an expanded access IND or expanded access protocol on clinical hold under the following conditions: \n(i) Final use. FDA may place a pro-\nposed expanded access IND or treat-ment use protocol on clinical hold if it is determined that: \n(A) The pertinent criteria in subpart \nI of this part for permitting the ex-panded access use to begin are not sat-isfied; or \n(B) The expanded access IND or ex-\npanded access protocol does not comply with the requirements for expanded ac-cess submissions in subpart I of this part. \n(ii) Ongoing use. FDA may place an \nongoing expanded access IND or ex-panded access protocol on clinical hold if it is determined that the pertinent criteria in subpart I of this part for \npermitting the expanded access are no longer satisfied. \n(4) Clinical hold of any study that is \nnot designed to be adequate and well-con-trolled.

FDA ordinarily intends that clinical holds under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii), (b)(4)(iii) and (b)(4)(v) of this section would only apply to additional enrollment in nonconcurrently con-trolled trials rather than eliminating continued access to individuals already receiving the investigational drug. \n(5) Clinical hold of any investigation in-\nvolving an exception from informed con-sent under \u00a7 50.24 of this chapter. FDA \nmay place a proposed or ongoing inves-tigation involving an exception from informed consent under \u00a7 50.24 of this chapter on clinical hold if it is deter-mined that: (i) Any of the conditions in para-\ngraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section apply; or \n(ii) The pertinent criteria in \u00a7 50.24 of \nthis chapter for such an investigation to begin or continue are not submitted or not satisfied. \n(6) Clinical hold of any investigation \ninvolving an exception from informed consent under \u00a7 50.23(d) of this chapter. FDA may place a proposed or ongoing investigation involving an exception from informed consent under \u00a7 50.23(d) of this chapter on clinical hold if it is determined that: \n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\ngraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section apply; or \n(ii) A determination by the President \nto waive the prior consent requirement for the administration of an investiga-tional new drug has not been made. \n(c) Discussion of deficiency. Whenever \nFDA concludes that a deficiency exists in a clinical investigation that may be grounds for the imposition of clinical hold FDA will, unless patients are ex-posed to immediate and serious risk, attempt to discuss and satisfactorily resolve the matter with the sponsor be-fore issuing the clinical hold order. \n(d) Imposition of clinical hold. The \nclinical hold order may be made by telephone or other means of rapid com-munication or in writing. The clinical hold order will identify the studies under the IND to which the hold ap-plies, and will briefly explain the basis for the action. The clinical hold order will be made by or on behalf of the Di-vision Director with responsibility for review of the IND. As soon as possible, and no more than 30 days after imposi-tion of the clinical hold, the Division Director will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. \n(e) Resumption of clinical investiga-\ntions.

Meetings between a spon-\nsor and the agency are frequently use-ful in resolving questions and issues raised during the course of a clinical investigation. FDA encourages such meetings to the extent that they aid in the evaluation of the drug and in the solution of scientific problems con-cerning the drug, to the extent that FDA\u2019s resources permit. The general principle underlying the conduct of such meetings is that there should be free, full, and open communication about any scientific or medical ques-tion that may arise during the clinical investigation. These meetings shall be conducted and documented in accord-\nance with part 10. \n(b) \u2018\u2018End-of-Phase 2\u2019\u2019 meetings and \nmeetings held before submission of a mar-keting application. At specific times \nduring the drug investigation process, meetings between FDA and a sponsor can be especially helpful in minimizing wasteful expenditures of time and money and thus in speeding the drug development and evaluation process. In particular, FDA has found that meet-ings at the end of Phase 2 of an inves-tigation (end-of-Phase 2 meetings) are of considerable assistance in planning later studies and that meetings held near completion of Phase 3 and before submission of a marketing application (\u2018\u2018pre-NDA\u2019\u2019 meetings) are helpful in developing methods of presentation and submission of data in the mar-keting application that facilitate re-view and allow timely FDA response. \n(1) End-of-Phase 2 meetings \u2014(i) Pur-\npose. The purpose of an end-of-phase 2 \nmeeting is to determine the safety of proceeding to Phase 3, to evaluate the Phase 3 plan and protocols and the ade-quacy of current studies and plans to assess pediatric safety and effective-ness, and to identify any additional in-formation necessary to support a mar-keting application for the uses under investigation. (ii) Eligibility for meeting. While the \nend-of-Phase 2 meeting is designed pri-marily for IND\u2019s involving new molec-ular entities or major new uses of mar-keted drugs, a sponsor of any IND may request and obtain an end-of-Phase 2 meeting. \n(iii) Timing. To be most useful to the \nsponsor, end-of-Phase 2 meetings should be held before major commit-ments of effort and resources to spe-cific Phase 3 tests are made. The sched-uling of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting is not, however, intended to delay the transition of an investigation from Phase 2 to Phase 3. \n(iv) Advance information. At least 1 \nmonth in advance of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting, the sponsor should submit background information on the spon-sor\u2019s plan for Phase 3, including sum-maries of the Phase 1 and 2 investiga-tions, the specific protocols for Phase 3 clinical studies, plans for any addi-tional nonclinical studies, plans for pe-diatric studies, including a time line for protocol finalization, enrollment, completion, and data analysis, or infor-mation to support any planned request for waiver or deferral of pediatric stud-ies, and, if available, tentative labeling for the drug. The recommended con-tents of such a submission are de-scribed more fully in FDA Staff Man-ual Guide 4850.7 that is publicly avail-able under FDA\u2019s public information regulations in part 20. \n(v) Conduct of meeting. Arrangements \nfor an end-of-Phase 2 meeting are to be made with the division in FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research which is responsible for review of the IND. The meeting will be scheduled by FDA at a time convenient to both FDA and the sponsor. Both the sponsor and FDA may bring consult-ants to the meeting. The meeting should be directed primarily at estab-lishing agreement between FDA and the sponsor of the overall plan for Phase 3 and the objectives and design of particular studies. The adequacy of the technical information to support Phase 3 studies and/or a marketing ap-plication may also be discussed. FDA will also provide its best judgment, at that time, of the pediatric studies that will be required for the drug product \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n75 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 312.48 \nand whether their submission will be \ndeferred until after approval. Agree-ments reached at the meeting on these matters will be recorded in minutes of the conference that will be taken by FDA in accordance with \u00a7 10.65 and pro-vided to the sponsor. The minutes along with any other written material provided to the sponsor will serve as a permanent record of any agreements reached. Barring a significant sci-entific development that requires oth-erwise, studies conducted in accord-ance with the agreement shall be pre-sumed to be sufficient in objective and design for the purpose of obtaining marketing approval for the drug. \n(2) \u2018\u2018Pre-NDA\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018pre-BLA\u2019\u2019 meet-\nings. FDA has found that delays associ-\nated with the initial review of a mar-keting application may be reduced by exchanges of information about a pro-posed marketing application. The pri-mary purpose of this kind of exchange is to uncover any major unresolved problems, to identify those studies that the sponsor is relying on as adequate and well-controlled to establish the drug\u2019s effectiveness, to identify the status of ongoing or needed studies adequate to assess pediatric safety and effectiveness, to acquaint FDA review-ers with the general information to be submitted in the marketing applica-tion (including technical information), to discuss appropriate methods for sta-tistical analysis of the data, and to dis-cuss the best approach to the presen-tation and formatting of data in the marketing application. Arrangements for such a meeting are to be initiated by the sponsor with the division re-sponsible for review of the IND. To per-mit FDA to provide the sponsor with the most useful advice on preparing a marketing application, the sponsor \nshould submit to FDA\u2019s reviewing divi-sion at least 1 month in advance of the meeting the following information: \n(i) A brief summary of the clinical \nstudies to be submitted in the applica-tion. \n(ii) A proposed format for organizing \nthe submission, including methods for presenting the data. \n(iii) Information on the status of \nneeded or ongoing pediatric studies. (iv) Any other information for discus-\nsion at the meeting. \n[52 FR 8831, Mar. 19, 1987, as amended at 52 \nFR 23031, June 17, 1987; 55 FR 11580, Mar. 29, 1990; 63 FR 66669, Dec. 2, 1998; 67 FR 9586, Mar. 4, 2002] ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/312.pdf", "part_title": "INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION", "subpart_title": "Administrative Actions", "section": "\u00a7 312.47 Meetings."}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 312.48 Dispute resolution.\n(a) General.

This subpart contains the \nrequirements for the use of investiga-tional new drugs and approved drugs where availability is limited by a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) when the primary purpose is to \ndiagnose, monitor, or treat a patient\u2019s disease or condition. The aim of this subpart is to facilitate the availability of such drugs to patients with serious diseases or conditions when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the patient\u2019s disease or condition. \n(b) Definitions. The following defini-\ntions of terms apply to this subpart: \nImmediately life-threatening disease or \ncondition means a stage of disease in \nwhich there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months or in which premature death is likely without early treatment. \nSerious disease or condition means a \ndisease or condition associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning. Short-lived and self-limiting morbidity will usu-ally not be sufficient, but the mor-bidity need not be irreversible, pro-vided it is persistent or recurrent. Whether a disease or condition is seri-ous is a matter of clinical judgment, based on its impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the disease, if left un-\ntreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one.

Expanded \naccess under this section may be need-ed in the following situations: \n(1) Drug not being developed. The drug \nis not being developed, for example, be-cause the disease or condition is so rare that the sponsor is unable to re-cruit patients for a clinical trial. (2) Drug being developed.

The 180-day period ends on the day before the date on which an ANDA submitted by an applicant other than a first applicant could be ap-proved. 505(b)(2) application is an NDA sub-\nmitted under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for a drug for which at least some of the investigations described in section 505(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the NDA were not conducted by or for the appli-cant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the in-vestigations were conducted. \nAbbreviated application, abbreviated \nnew drug application, or ANDA is the ap-\nplication described under \u00a7 314.94, in-cluding all amendments and supple-ments to the application. \nAcknowledgment letter is a written, \npostmarked communication from FDA to an applicant stating that the Agen-cy has determined that an ANDA is sufficiently complete to permit a sub-stantive review. An acknowledgment letter indicates that the ANDA is re-garded as received. \nAct is the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (section 201 et seq. (21 \nU.S.C. 301 et seq. )). \nActive ingredient is any component \nthat is intended to furnish pharma-cological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals. The term includes those components that may undergo chemical change in the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect. \nActive moiety is the molecule or ion, \nexcluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hy-drogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a com-plex, chelate, or clathrate) of the mol-ecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. \nANDA holder is the applicant that \nowns an approved ANDA. \nApplicant is any person who submits \nan NDA (including a 505(b)(2) applica-tion) or ANDA or an amendment or supplement to an NDA or ANDA under this part to obtain FDA approval of a \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n97 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 314.3 \nnew drug and any person who owns an \napproved NDA (including a 505(b)(2) ap-plication) or ANDA. \nApplication, new drug application, or \nNDA is the application described under ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/314.pdf", "part_title": "APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG", "subpart_title": "General Provisions", "section": "\u00a7 314.3 Definitions."}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 314.50, including all amendments and supplements to the application. An NDA refers to \u2018\u2018stand-alone\u2019\u2019 applica-tions submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act and to 505(b)(2) applications.\nApproval letter is a written commu-\nnication to an applicant from FDA ap-proving an NDA or an ANDA. \nAssess the effects of the change is to \nevaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, qual-ity, purity, and potency of a drug prod-uct as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug prod-uct. \nAuthorized generic drug is a listed \ndrug, as defined in this section, that has been approved under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act and is marketed, sold, or dis-tributed directly or indirectly to the retail class of trade with labeling, packaging (other than repackaging as the listed drug in blister packs, unit doses, or similar packaging for use in institutions), product code, labeler code, trade name, or trademark that differs from that of the listed drug. \nBioavailability is the rate and extent \nto which the active ingredient or ac-tive moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of drug action. For drug products that are not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bioavailability may be assessed by scientifically valid measurements intended to reflect the rate and extent to which the active in-gredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of drug action. \nBioequivalence is the absence of a sig-\nnificant difference in the rate and ex-tent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alter-natives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar condi-tions in an appropriately designed study. Where there is an intentional difference in rate (e.g., in certain ex-tended-release dosage forms), certain pharmaceutical equivalents or alter-natives may be considered bioequiva-\nlent if there is no significant difference in the extent to which the active ingre-dient or moiety from each product be-comes available at the site of drug ac-tion. This applies only if the difference in the rate at which the active ingre-dient or moiety becomes available at the site of drug action is intentional and is reflected in the proposed label-ing, is not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on chronic use, and is considered medi-cally insignificant for the drug. For drug products that are not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bio-equivalence may be assessed by sci-entifically valid measurements in-tended to reflect the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of drug action. \nBioequivalence requirement is a re-\nquirement imposed by FDA for in vitro and/or in vivo testing of specified drug products that must be satisfied as a condition of marketing. \nClass 1 resubmission is the resubmis-\nsion of an NDA or efficacy supplement, following receipt of a complete re-sponse letter, that contains one or more of the following: Final printed la-beling, draft labeling, certain safety updates, stability updates to support provisional or final dating periods, commitments to perform post-marketing studies (including proposals for such studies), assay validation data, final release testing on the last lots used to support approval, minor reanalyses of previously submitted data, and other comparatively minor information. \nClass 2 resubmission is the resubmis-\nsion of an NDA or efficacy supplement, following receipt of a complete re-sponse letter, that includes any item not specified in the definition of \u2018\u2018Class 1 resubmission,\u2019\u2019 including any item that would require presentation to an advisory committee. \nCommercial marketing is the introduc-\ntion or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a drug product described in an ANDA, outside the con-trol of the ANDA applicant, except that the term does not include transfer of the drug product for investigational use under part 312 of this chapter or \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n98 21 CFR Ch.

Commercial mar-keting includes the introduction or de-livery for introduction into interstate commerce of the reference listed drug by the ANDA applicant. \nComplete response letter is a written \ncommunication to an applicant from FDA usually describing all of the defi-ciencies that the Agency has identified in an NDA or ANDA that must be satis-\nfactorily addressed before it can be ap-proved. \nComponent is any ingredient intended \nfor use in the manufacture of a drug product, including those that may not appear in such drug product. \nDate of approval is the date on the ap-\nproval letter from FDA stating that the NDA or ANDA is approved, except that the date of approval for an NDA described in section 505(x)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is determined as described in section 505(x)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \u2018\u2018Date of approval\u2019\u2019 re-fers only to a final approval and not to a tentative approval. \nDosage form is the physical mani-\nfestation containing the active and in-active ingredients that delivers a dose of the drug product. This includes such factors as: \n(1) The physical appearance of the \ndrug product; \n(2) The physical form of the drug \nproduct prior to dispensing to the pa-tient; \n(3) The way the product is adminis-\ntered; and \n(4) The design features that affect \nfrequency of dosing. \nDrug product is a finished dosage \nform, e.g., tablet, capsule, or solution, that contains a drug substance, gen-erally, but not necessarily, in associa-tion with one or more other ingredi-ents. \nDrug substance is an active ingredient \nthat is intended to furnish pharma-cological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the human body, but does not in-clude intermediates used in the syn-thesis of such ingredient. Efficacy supplement is a supplement \nto an approved NDA proposing to make one or more related changes from among the following changes to prod-uct labeling: \n(1) Add or modify an indication or \nclaim; \n(2) Revise the dose or dose regimen; (3) Provide for a new route of admin-\nistration; \n(4) Make a comparative efficacy \nclaim naming another drug product; \n(5) Significantly alter the intended \npatient population; \n(6) Change the marketing status from \nprescription to over-the-counter use; \n(7) Provide for, or provide evidence of \neffectiveness necessary for, the tradi-tional approval of a product originally approved under subpart H of this part; or \n(8) Incorporate other information \nbased on at least one adequate and well-controlled clinical study. \nFDA or Agency is the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \nFirst applicant is an ANDA applicant \nthat, on the first day on which a sub-stantially complete application con-taining a paragraph IV certification is submitted for approval of a drug, sub-mits a substantially complete applica-tion that contains, and for which the applicant lawfully maintains, a para-graph IV certification for the drug. \nInactive ingredient is any component \nother than an active ingredient. \nListed drug is a new drug product that \nhas been approved under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act for safety and effectiveness or under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which has not been withdrawn or suspended under section 505(e)(1) through (5) or section 505(j)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and which has not been withdrawn from sale for what FDA has determined are reasons of safety or effectiveness.

Except as provided in \u00a7 314.53(f)(1), an NDA holder\u2019s amendment to the de-scription of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent will be con-sidered untimely filing of patent infor-mation unless: \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00118 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n109 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 314.50 \n(A) The amendment to the descrip-\ntion of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of patent issuance; \n(B) The amendment to the descrip-\ntion of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of approval of a cor-responding change to product labeling; or \n(C) The amendment to the descrip-\ntion of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or by a Federal district court, the Court of Ap-peals for the Federal Circuit, or the U.S. Supreme Court that is specific to the patent and alters the construction of a method-of-use claim(s) of the pat-ent, and the amendment contains a copy of the decision. \n(ii) An applicant whose 505(b)(2) ap-\nplication is submitted after the NDA holder\u2019s untimely filing of patent in-formation or whose 505(b)(2) applica-tion was previously filed but did not contain an appropriate patent certifi-cation or statement at the time of the patent submission must submit a cer-tification under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and/or a statement under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section as to that patent. \n(5) Disputed patent information. If an \napplicant disputes the accuracy or rel-evance of patent information sub-mitted to FDA, the applicant may seek a confirmation of the correctness of the patent information in accordance with the procedures under \u00a7 314.53(f). Unless the patent information is with-drawn, the applicant must submit an appropriate certification or statement for each listed patent. \n(6) Amended certifications. A patent \ncertification or statement submitted under paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section may be amended at any time before the approval of the 505(b)(2) application. An applicant must submit an amended certification as an amend-ment to a pending 505(b)(2) application. If an applicant with a pending 505(b)(2) application voluntarily makes a patent certification for an untimely filed pat-ent, the applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed patent. Once an amendment is submitted to change the certification, \nthe 505(b)(2) application will no longer be considered to contain the prior cer-tification. \n(i) After finding of infringement. An ap-\nplicant who has submitted a paragraph IV certification and is sued for patent infringement must submit an amend-ment to change its certification if a court enters a final decision from which no appeal has been or can be taken, or signs and enters a settlement order or consent decree in the action that includes a finding that the patent is infringed, unless the final decision, settlement order, or consent decree also finds the patent to be invalid. In its amendment, the applicant must cer-tify under paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A)( 3) of \nthis section that the patent will expire on a specific date or, with respect to a patent claiming a method of use, the applicant may instead provide a state-ment under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section if the applicant amends its 505(b)(2) application such that the ap-plicant is no longer seeking approval for a method of use claimed by the pat-ent. Once an amendment for the change has been submitted, the 505(b)(2) application will no longer be considered to contain a paragraph IV certification to the patent. If a final decision finds the patent to be invalid and infringed, an amended certification is not required. \n(ii) After request to remove a patent or \npatent information from the list.

A 505(b)(2) applicant is not required to provide or maintain a certification to a patent or patent information that re-mains listed only for purposes of a first applicant\u2019s 180-day exclusivity for its ANDA. Once an amendment to with-draw the certification has been sub-mitted, the 505(b)(2) application will no longer be considered to contain a para-graph IV certification to the patent. If removal of a patent from the list re-sults in there being no patents listed for the listed drug(s) identified in the 505(b)(2) application, the applicant must submit an amended certification reflecting that there are no listed pat-ents. \n(iii) Other amendments. (A) Except as \nprovided in paragraphs (i)(4) and (i)(6)(iii)(B) of this section: \n(1) An applicant must amend a sub-\nmitted certification or statement if, at any time before the approval of the 505(b)(2) application, the applicant learns that the submitted certification or statement is no longer accurate; and \n(2) An applicant must submit an ap-\npropriate patent certification or state-ment under paragraph (i)(1) of this sec-tion if, after submission of the 505(b)(2) application, a new patent is issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that, in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge, claims a listed drug relied upon or that claims an approved use for such listed drug for which information is required to be filed under section 505(b) and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act and \u00a7 314.53. \n(B) An applicant is not required to \nsubmit a supplement to change a sub-mitted certification when information on an otherwise applicable patent is submitted after the approval of the 505(b)(2) application. \n(j) Claimed exclusivity. A new drug \nproduct, upon approval, may be enti-tled to a period of marketing exclu-sivity under the provisions of \u00a7 314.108. If an applicant believes its drug prod-uct is entitled to a period of exclu-sivity, it must submit with the NDA prior to approval the following infor-\nmation: \n(1) A statement that the applicant is \nclaiming exclusivity. \n(2) A reference to the appropriate \nparagraph under \u00a7 314.108 that supports its claim. \n(3) If the applicant claims exclusivity \nunder \u00a7 314.108(b)(2), information to show that, to the best of its knowledge or belief, a drug has not previously been approved under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act containing any active moiety in the drug for which the applicant is seeking approval. \n(4) If the applicant claims exclusivity \nunder \u00a7 314.108(b)(4) or (b)(5), the fol-lowing information to show that the NDA contains \u2018\u2018new clinical investiga-tions\u2019\u2019 that are \u2018\u2018essential to approval of the NDA or supplement\u2019\u2019 and were \u2018\u2018conducted or sponsored by the appli-cant:\u2019\u2019 \n(i) \u2018\u2018New clinical investigations. \u2019\u2019 A cer-\ntification that to the best of the appli-cant\u2019s knowledge each of the clinical investigations included in the NDA meets the definition of \u2018\u2018new clinical investigation\u2019\u2019 set forth in \u00a7 314.108(a). \n(ii) \u2018\u2018Essential to approval.\u2019\u2019 A list of \nall published studies or publicly avail-able reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant through a lit-erature search that are relevant to the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval, a certification that the applicant has thoroughly searched the scientific literature and, to the best of the applicant\u2019s knowledge, the list is complete and accurate and, in the applicant\u2019s opinion, such published studies or publicly available reports do not provide a sufficient basis for the approval of the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval with-out reference to the new clinical inves-tigation(s) in the NDA, and an expla-nation as to why the studies or reports are insufficient. \n(iii) \u2018\u2018Conducted or sponsored by.\u2019\u2019 If \nthe applicant was the sponsor named in the Form FDA 1571 for an IND under which the new clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its NDA was conducted, identification of the IND by number.

To demonstrate \u2018\u2018substantial support,\u2019\u2019 an applicant must either provide a cer-tified statement from a certified public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of con-ducting the study or provide an expla-nation of why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or spon-sored the study if the applicant\u2019s finan-cial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new drug. A predecessor in interest is an entity, e.g., a corporation, that the applicant has taken over, merged with, or pur-chased, or from which the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of nonexclusive rights to a clinical investigation after it is com-pleted is not sufficient to satisfy this definition. \n(k) Financial certification or disclosure \nstatement. The NDA must contain a fi-\nnancial certification or disclosure statement or both as required by part 54 of this chapter. \n(l) Format of an original NDA \u2014(1) Ar-\nchival copy. The applicant must submit \na complete archival copy of the NDA that contains the information required under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section. FDA will maintain the archi-val copy during the review of the NDA to permit individual reviewers to refer to information that is not contained in their particular technical sections of the NDA, to give other agency per-sonnel access to the NDA for official business, and to maintain in one place a complete copy of the NDA. Except as required by paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, applicants may submit the ar-chival copy on paper or in electronic format provided that electronic sub-missions are made in accordance with part 11 of this chapter. \n(i) Labeling.

The applicant may \nobtain from FDA sufficient folders to bind the archival, the review, and the field copies of the NDA. \n(5) Electronic format submissions. Elec-\ntronic format submissions must be in a form that FDA can process, review, and archive.

For patents that claim a drug product, the applicant must submit information only on those patents that claim the drug product, as is defined in \u00a7 314.3, that is described in the pending or approved NDA. For pat-ents that claim a method of use, the applicant must submit information only on those patents that claim indi-cations or other conditions of use for which approval is sought or has been granted in the NDA. The applicant must separately identify each pending or approved method of use and related patent claim(s). For approved NDAs, the NDA holder\u2019s description of the patented method of use required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(P)( 3) of this section \nmust describe only the approved meth-od(s) of use claimed by the patent for which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product. If the meth-od(s) of use claimed by the patent does not cover an indication or other ap-proved condition of use in its entirety, the applicant must describe only the specific approved method of use claimed by the patent for which a claim of patent infringement could rea-sonably be asserted if a person not li-censed by the owner of the patent en-gaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product. For approved NDAs, the NDA holder submitting in-formation on the method-of-use patent must identify with specificity the sec-tion(s) and subsection(s) of the ap-proved labeling that describes the method(s) of use claimed by the patent submitted. Process patents, patents claiming packaging, patents claiming metabolites, and patents claiming intermediates are not covered by this section, and information on these pat-ents must not be submitted to FDA. \n(2) Test data for submission of patent \ninformation for patents that claim only a polymorph. The test data, referenced in \nparagraph (b)(1) of this section, must include the following: \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00124 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n115 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 314.53 \n(i) A full description of the poly-\nmorphic form of the drug substance, in-cluding its physical and chemical char-acteristics and stability; the method of synthesis (or isolation) and purifi-cation of the drug substance; the proc-ess controls used during manufacture and packaging; and such specifications and analytical methods as are nec-essary to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the polymorphic form of the drug substance; \n(ii) The executed batch record for a \ndrug product containing the poly-morphic form of the drug substance and documentation that the batch was manufactured under current good man-ufacturing practice requirements; \n(iii) Demonstration of bioequivalence \nbetween the executed batch of the drug product that contains the polymorphic form of the drug substance and the drug product as described in the NDA; \n(iv) A list of all components used in \nthe manufacture of the drug product containing the polymorphic form and a statement of the composition of the drug product; a statement of the speci-fications and analytical methods for each component; a description of the manufacturing and packaging proce-dures and in-process controls for the drug product; such specifications and analytical methods as are necessary to assure the identity, strength, quality, purity, and bioavailability of the drug product, including release and stability data complying with the approved product specifications to demonstrate pharmaceutical equivalence and com-parable product stability; and \n(v) Comparative in vitro dissolution \ntesting on 12 dosage units each of the executed test batch and the NDA prod-uct. \n(c) Reporting requirements \u2014(1) General \nrequirements.

An applicant may re-\nquest a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the ap-plicant certifies that: \n(i) The drug product does not rep-\nresent a meaningful therapeutic ben-efit over existing treatments for pedi-atric patients and is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pedi-atric patients; \n(ii) Necessary studies are impossible \nor highly impractical because, e.g., the number of such patients is so small or geographically dispersed; or \n(iii) There is evidence strongly sug-\ngesting that the drug product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups. \n(3) Partial waiver. An applicant may \nrequest a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with re-spect to a specified pediatric age group, if the applicant certifies that: \n(i) The drug product does not rep-\nresent a meaningful therapeutic ben-efit over existing treatments for pedi-atric patients in that age group, and is not likely to be used in a substantial number of patients in that age group; (ii) Necessary studies are impossible \nor highly impractical because, e.g., the number of patients in that age group is so small or geographically dispersed; \n(iii) There is evidence strongly sug-\ngesting that the drug product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group; or \n(iv) The applicant can demonstrate \nthat reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed. \n(4) FDA action on waiver. FDA shall \ngrant a full or partial waiver, as appro-priate, if the agency finds that there is a reasonable basis on which to con-clude that one or more of the grounds for waiver specified in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section have been met. If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pedi-atric formulation, the waiver will cover only those pediatric age groups requiring that formulation. If a waiver is granted because there is evidence that the product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, this information will be included in the product\u2019s labeling. \n(5) Definition of \u2018\u2018meaningful thera-\npeutic benefit\u2019\u2019.

FDA generally \nassumes that when an original NDA, supplement to an approved NDA, or re-submission of an NDA or supplement is submitted to the Agency for review, the applicant believes that the Agency can approve the NDA, supplement, or resubmission as submitted. However, the applicant may submit an amend-ment to an NDA, supplement, or resub-mission that has been filed under \u00a7 314.101 but is not yet approved. \n(b) Submission of major amendment. (1) \nSubmission of a major amendment to an original NDA, efficacy supplement, or resubmission of an NDA or efficacy supplement within 3 months of the end of the initial review cycle constitutes an agreement by the applicant under \nsection 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to extend the initial review cycle by 3 months. (For references to a resubmission of an NDA or efficacy supplement in paragraph (b) of this section, the timeframe for re-viewing the resubmission is the \u2018\u2018re-view cycle\u2019\u2019 rather than the \u2018\u2018initial re-view cycle.\u2019\u2019) FDA may instead defer review of the amendment until the sub-sequent review cycle. If the agency ex-tends the initial review cycle for an original NDA, efficacy supplement, or resubmission under this paragraph, the division responsible for reviewing the NDA, supplement, or resubmission will notify the applicant of the extension. The initial review cycle for an original NDA, efficacy supplement, or resubmis-sion of an NDA or efficacy supplement may be extended only once due to sub-mission of a major amendment. FDA may, at its discretion, review any sub-sequent major amendment during the initial review cycle (as extended) or defer review until the subsequent re-view cycle. \n(2) Submission of a major amend-\nment to an original NDA, efficacy sup-plement, or resubmission of an NDA or efficacy supplement more than 3 months before the end of the initial re-view cycle will not extend the cycle. FDA may, at its discretion, review \nsuch an amendment during the initial review cycle or defer review until the subsequent review cycle. \n(3) Submission of an amendment to \nan original NDA, efficacy supplement, or resubmission of an NDA or efficacy supplement that is not a major amend-ment will not extend the initial review cycle. FDA may, at its discretion, re-view such an amendment during the initial review cycle or defer review until the subsequent review cycle. \n(4) Submission of a major amend-\nment to a manufacturing supplement within 2 months of the end of the ini-tial review cycle constitutes an agree-ment by the applicant under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to extend the initial re-view cycle by 2 months. FDA may in-stead defer review of the amendment until the subsequent review cycle. If the agency extends the initial review cycle for a manufacturing supplement under this paragraph, the division re-sponsible for reviewing the supplement will notify the applicant of the exten-sion. The initial review cycle for a manufacturing supplement may be ex-tended only once due to submission of a major amendment. FDA may, at its discretion, review any subsequent major amendment during the initial review cycle (as extended) or defer re-view until the subsequent review cycle. \n(5) Submission of an amendment to a \nsupplement other than an efficacy or manufacturing supplement will not ex-tend the initial review cycle. FDA may, at its discretion, review such an amendment during the initial review cycle or defer review until the subse-quent review cycle. \n(6) A major amendment may not in-\nclude data to support an indication or claim that was not included in the original NDA, supplement, or resub-mission, but it may include data to support a minor modification of an in-dication or claim that was included in the original NDA, supplement, or re-submission. \n(7) When FDA defers review of an \namendment until the subsequent re-view cycle, the agency will notify the applicant of the deferral in the com-plete response letter sent to the appli-cant under \u00a7 314.110 of this part. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00135 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n126 21 CFR Ch.

The amendment will be considered a resub-mission of the NDA, which may not be accepted except as provided in accord-ance with section 505(c)(3)(E)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \n(d) Field copy. The applicant must \nsubmit a field copy of each amendment to a section of the NDA described in \u00a7 314.50(d)(1). The applicant must in-clude in its submission of each such amendment to FDA a statement certi-fying that a field copy of the amend-ment has been sent to the applicant\u2019s home FDA district office. \n(e) Different drug. An applicant may \nnot amend a 505(b)(2) application to seek approval of a drug that is a dif-ferent drug from the drug in the origi-nal submission of the 505(b)(2) applica-tion. For purposes of this paragraph (e), a drug is a different drug if it has been modified to have a different ac-tive ingredient, different route of ad-ministration, different dosage form, or difference in excipients that requires either a separate clinical study to es-tablish safety or effectiveness or, for topical products, that requires a sepa-rate in vivo demonstration of bio-\nequivalence.

A substantial disruption of \na person\u2019s ability to conduct normal life functions. \nLife-threatening adverse drug experi-\nence. Any adverse drug experience that \nplaces the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of \ndeath from the adverse drug experience as it occurred, i.e., it does not include \nan adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. \nSerious adverse drug experience. Any \nadverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the fol-lowing outcomes: Death, a life-threat-ening adverse drug experience, inpa-tient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Im-portant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be consid-ered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the pa-tient or subject and may require med-ical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defi-nition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \nUnexpected adverse drug experience. \nAny adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differ from the event because of greater se-verity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thrombo-embolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. \u2018\u2018Unex-pected,\u2019\u2019 as used in this definition, re-fers to an adverse drug experience that \nhas not been previously observed ( i.e., \nincluded in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharma-cological properties of the pharma-ceutical product. \n(b) Review of adverse drug experiences. \nEach applicant having an approved ap-plication under \u00a7 314.50 or, in the case of a 505(b)(2) application, an effective approved application, must promptly review all adverse drug experience in-formation obtained or otherwise re-ceived by the applicant from any source, foreign or domestic, including information derived from commercial marketing experience, postmarketing clinical investigations, postmarketing epidemiological/surveillance studies, reports in the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers. Appli-cants are not required to resubmit to FDA adverse drug experience reports forwarded to the applicant by FDA; however, applicants must submit all followup information on such reports to FDA. Any person subject to the re-porting requirements under paragraph (c) of this section must also develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experi-ences to FDA. \n(c) Reporting requirements. The appli-\ncant must submit to FDA adverse drug experience information as described in this section. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, these reports must be submitted to the Agen-cy in electronic format as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. \n(1)(i) Postmarketing 15-day \u2018\u2018Alert re-\nports\u2019\u2019. The applicant must report each \nadverse drug experience that is both se-rious and unexpected, whether foreign or domestic, as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days from initial receipt of the information by the appli-cant. \n(ii) Postmarketing 15-day \u2018\u2018Alert re-\nports\u2019\u2019\u2014followup. The applicant must \npromptly investigate all adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing 15-day Alert re-ports and must submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA.

The re-\nquirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, concerning the submission of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, also apply to any person other than the applicant whose name appears on the label of an approved drug product as a manufacturer, pack-er, or distributor (nonapplicant). To avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, obligations of a non-applicant may be met by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug ex-periences to the applicant. If a non-applicant elects to submit adverse drug experience reports to the applicant rather than to FDA, the nonapplicant must submit, by any appropriate means, each report to the applicant within 5 calendar days of initial receipt of the information by the non-applicant, and the applicant must then comply with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the nonapplicant must maintain a record of this action which must include: \n(A) A copy of each adverse drug expe-\nrience report; \n(B) The date the report was received \nby the nonapplicant; \n(C) The date the report was sub-\nmitted to the applicant; and \n(D) The name and address of the ap-\nplicant. \n(2) Periodic adverse drug experience re-\nports. (i) The applicant must report \neach adverse drug experience not re-ported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section at quarterly intervals, for 3 years from the date of approval of the application, and then at annual inter-vals. The applicant must submit each quarterly report within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first quarter beginning on the date of approval of the application) and each annual report within 60 days of the anniversary date of approval of the application. Upon written notice, FDA may extend or re-establish the requirement that an ap-plicant submit quarterly reports, or re-quire that the applicant submit reports under this section at different times than those stated. For example, the agency may reestablish a quarterly re-\nporting requirement following the ap-proval of a major supplement. Fol-lowup information to adverse drug ex-periences submitted in a periodic re-port may be submitted in the next peri-odic report. \n(ii) Each periodic report is required \nto contain: \n(A) Descriptive information. (1) A nar-\nrative summary and analysis of the in-formation in the report; \n(2) An analysis of the 15-day Alert re-\nports submitted during the reporting interval (all 15-day Alert reports being appropriately referenced by the appli-cant\u2019s patient identification code, ad-verse reaction term(s), and date of sub-mission to FDA); \n(3) A history of actions taken since \nthe last report because of adverse drug experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated); and \n(4) An index consisting of a line list-\ning", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/314.pdf", "part_title": "APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG", "subpart_title": "Applications", "section": "\u00a7 314.80 Postmarketing reporting of"}}, {"page_content": "-day Alert re-\nports submitted during the reporting interval (all 15-day Alert reports being appropriately referenced by the appli-cant\u2019s patient identification code, ad-verse reaction term(s), and date of sub-mission to FDA); \n(3) A history of actions taken since \nthe last report because of adverse drug experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated); and \n(4) An index consisting of a line list-\ning of the applicant\u2019s patient identi-fication code, and adverse reaction term(s) for all ICSRs submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. \n(B) ICSRs for serious, expected, and \nnonserious adverse drug experiences. An \nICSR for each adverse drug experience not reported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (all serious, expected \nand nonserious adverse drug experi-ences). All such ICSRs must be sub-mitted to FDA (either individually or in one or more batches) within the timeframe specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. ICSRs must only be submitted to FDA once. \n(iii) Periodic reporting, except for in-\nformation regarding 15-day Alert re-ports, does not apply to adverse drug experience information obtained from postmarketing studies (whether or not conducted under an investigational new drug application), from reports in the scientific literature, and from for-eign marketing experience. \n(d) Scientific literature. A 15-day Alert \nreport based on information in the sci-entific literature must be accompanied by a copy of the published article.

FDA will issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, preparation and organiza-tion of files). \n(2) An applicant or nonapplicant may \nrequest, in writing, a temporary waiver of the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. These waivers will be granted on a limited basis for good cause shown. FDA will issue guidance on requesting a waiver of the require-ments in paragraph (g)(1) of this sec-tion. \n(h) Multiple reports. An applicant \nshould not include in reports under this section any adverse drug experi-ences that occurred in clinical trials if they were previously submitted as part of the approved application. If a report applies to a drug for which an appli-cant holds more than one approved ap-plication, the applicant should submit the report to the application that was first approved. If a report refers to more than one drug marketed by an ap-plicant, the applicant should submit the report to the application for the drug listed first in the report. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00144 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n135 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 314.81 \n(i) Patient privacy. An applicant \nshould not include in reports under this section the names and addresses of individual patients; instead, the appli-cant should assign a unique code for identification of the patient. The appli-cant should include the name of the re-porter from whom the information was received as part of the initial reporter information, even when the reporter is the patient. The names of patients, health care professionals, hospitals, and geographical identifiers in adverse drug experience reports are not releas-able to the public under FDA\u2019s public information regulations in part 20 of this chapter. \n(j) Recordkeeping. The applicant must \nmaintain for a period of 10 years records of all adverse drug experiences known to the applicant, including raw data and any correspondence relating to adverse drug experiences. \n(k) Withdrawal of approval. If an ap-\nplicant fails to establish and maintain records and make reports required under this section, FDA may withdraw approval of the application and, thus, prohibit continued marketing of the drug product that is the subject of the application. \n(l) Disclaimer. A report or information \nsubmitted by an applicant under this section (and any release by FDA of that report or information) does not necessarily reflect a conclusion by the \napplicant or FDA that the report or in-formation constitutes an admission that the drug caused or contributed to an adverse effect. An applicant need not admit, and may deny, that the re-port or information submitted under this section constitutes an admission that the drug caused or contributed to an adverse effect.

If the ANDA \nis for a drug or method of using a drug claimed by a patent and the applicant has a licensing agreement with the pat-ent owner, the applicant must submit a paragraph IV certification as to that patent and a statement that the appli-cant has been granted a patent license. If the patent owner consents to ap-proval of the ANDA (if otherwise eligi-\nble for approval) as of a specific date, the ANDA must contain a written statement from the patent owner that it has a licensing agreement with the applicant and that it consents to ap-proval of the ANDA as of a specific date. \n(vi) Untimely filing of patent informa-\ntion. (A) If a patent on the listed drug \nis issued and the holder of the approved NDA for the listed drug does not file with FDA the required information on the patent within 30 days of issuance of the patent, an applicant who submitted an ANDA for that drug that contained an appropriate patent certification or statement before the submission of the patent information is not required to submit a patent certification or state-ment to address the patent or patent information that is late-listed with re-spect to the pending ANDA. Except as provided in \u00a7 314.53(f)(1), an NDA hold-er\u2019s amendment to the description of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent will be considered un-timely filing of patent information un-less: \n(1) The amendment to the description \nof the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of patent issuance; \n(2) The amendment to the description \nof the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of approval of a cor-responding change to product labeling; or \n(3) The amendment to the description \nof the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or by a Federal district court, the Court of Ap-peals for the Federal Circuit, or the U.S. Supreme Court that is specific to the patent and alters the construction of a method-of-use claim(s) of the pat-ent, and the amendment contains a copy of the decision. \n(B) An applicant whose ANDA is sub-\nmitted after the NDA holder\u2019s un-timely filing of patent information, or whose pending ANDA was previously submitted but did not contain an ap-propriate patent certification or state-ment at the time of the patent submis-sion, must submit a certification under \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00157 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n148 21 CFR Ch.

If an \napplicant disputes the accuracy or rel-evance of patent information sub-mitted to FDA, the applicant may seek a confirmation of the correctness of the patent information in accordance with the procedures under \u00a7 314.53(f). Unless the patent information is with-drawn, the applicant must submit an appropriate certification or statement for each listed patent. \n(viii) Amended certifications. A patent \ncertification or statement submitted under paragraphs (a)(12)(i) through (iii) of this section may be amended at any time before the approval of the ANDA. If an applicant with a pending ANDA voluntarily makes a patent certifi-cation for an untimely filed patent, the applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed pat-ent. An applicant must submit an amended certification as an amend-ment to a pending ANDA. Once an amendment is submitted to change a certification, the ANDA will no longer be considered to contain the prior cer-tification. \n(A) After finding of infringement. An \napplicant who has submitted a para-graph IV certification and is sued for patent infringement must submit an amendment to change its certification if a court enters a final decision from which no appeal has been or can be taken, or signs and enters a settlement order or consent decree in the action that includes a finding that the patent is infringed, unless the final decision, settlement order, or consent decree also finds the patent to be invalid. In its amendment, the applicant must cer-tify under paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)( 3) of \nthis section that the patent will expire on a specific date or, with respect to a patent claiming a method of use, the applicant may instead provide a state-ment under paragraph (a)(12)(iii) of this section if the applicant amends its ANDA such that the applicant is no longer seeking approval for a method of use claimed by the patent. Once an amendment for the change has been submitted, the ANDA will no longer be considered to contain a paragraph IV certification to the patent. If a final \njudgment finds the patent to be invalid and infringed, an amended certification is not required. \n(B) After request to remove a patent or \npatent information from the list. If the \nlist reflects that an NDA holder has re-quested that a patent or patent infor-mation be removed from the list and no ANDA applicant is eligible for 180-day exclusivity based on a paragraph IV certification to that patent, the patent or patent information will be removed and any applicant with a pending \nANDA (including a tentatively ap-proved ANDA) who has made a certifi-cation with respect to such patent must submit an amendment to with-draw its certification. In the amend", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/314.pdf", "part_title": "APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG", "subpart_title": "Abbreviated", "section": "\u00a7 314.94 Content and format of an"}}, {"page_content": " has re-quested that a patent or patent infor-mation be removed from the list and no ANDA applicant is eligible for 180-day exclusivity based on a paragraph IV certification to that patent, the patent or patent information will be removed and any applicant with a pending \nANDA (including a tentatively ap-proved ANDA) who has made a certifi-cation with respect to such patent must submit an amendment to with-draw its certification. In the amend-ment, the applicant must state the rea-son for withdrawing the certification or statement (that the patent has been removed from the list). If the list re-flects that an NDA holder has re-quested that a patent or patent infor-mation be removed from the list and one or more first applicants are eligi-ble for 180-day exclusivity based on a paragraph IV certification to that pat-ent, the patent will remain listed until any 180-day exclusivity based on that patent has expired or has been extin-guished. After any applicable 180-day exclusivity has expired or has been ex-tinguished, the patent or patent infor-mation will be removed and any appli-cant with a pending ANDA (including a tentatively approved ANDA) who has made a certification with respect to such patent must submit an amend-ment to withdraw its certification. Once an amendment to withdraw the certification has been submitted, the ANDA will no longer be considered to contain a paragraph IV certification to the patent. If removal of a patent from the list results in there being no pat-ents listed for the listed drug identified in the ANDA, the applicant must sub-mit an amended certification reflecting that there are no relevant patents. \n(C) Other amendments.

For a paragraph IV certifi-cation, the certification must not be submitted earlier than the first work-ing day after the day the patent is pub-lished in the list. \n(2) An applicant is not required to \nsubmit a supplement to change a sub-mitted certification when information on a patent on the listed drug is sub-mitted after the approval of the ANDA. \n(13) Financial certification or disclosure \nstatement. An ANDA must contain a fi-\nnancial certification or disclosure statement as required by part 54 of this chapter. \n(b) Drug products subject to the Drug \nEfficacy Study Implementation (DESI) re-view. If the ANDA is for a duplicate of \na drug product that is subject to FDA\u2019s DESI review (a review of drug products approved as safe between 1938 and 1962) or other DESI-like review and the drug product evaluated in the review is a listed drug, the applicant must comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. \n(c) [Reserved] (d) Format of an ANDA. (1) The appli-\ncant must submit a complete archival copy of the ANDA as required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section. FDA will maintain the archival copy during the review of the ANDA to per-mit individual reviewers to refer to in-formation that is not contained in their particular technical sections of the ANDA, to give other Agency per-sonnel access to the ANDA for official business, and to maintain in one place a complete copy of the ANDA. \n(i) Format of submission. An applicant \nmay submit portions of the archival copy of the ANDA in any form that the applicant and FDA agree is acceptable, \nexcept as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. \n(ii) Labeling. The content of labeling \nrequired under \u00a7 201.100(d)(3) of this chapter (commonly referred to as the package insert or professional label-ing), including all text, tables, and fig-ures, must be submitted to the agency in electronic format as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. This requirement applies to the con-tent of labeling for the proposed drug product only and is in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section that copies of the for-matted label and all proposed labeling be submitted. Submissions under this paragraph must be made in accordance with part 11 of this chapter, except for the requirements of \u00a7 11.10(a), (c) through (h), and (k), and the cor-responding requirements of \u00a7 11.30. \n(iii) Electronic format submissions. \nElectronic format submissions must be in a form that FDA can process, re-view, and archive. FDA will periodi-cally issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, preparation and organization of files). \n(2) For ANDAs, the applicant must \nsubmit a review copy of the ANDA that contains two separate sections. One section must contain the information described under paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) and (8) and (9) of this sec-tion and section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and a copy of the analytical procedures and descriptive information needed by FDA\u2019s laboratories to perform tests on samples of the proposed drug product and to validate the applicant\u2019s analyt-ical procedures.

During the \ncourse of reviewing an application or an abbreviated application, FDA shall communicate with applicants about scientific, medical, and procedural issues that arise during the review process. Such communication may take the form of telephone conversa-tions, letters, or meetings, whichever is most appropriate to discuss the par-ticular issue at hand. Communications shall be appropriately documented in the application in accordance with \u00a7 10.65 of this chapter. Further details on the procedures for communication between FDA and applicants are con-tained in a staff manual guide that is publicly available. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00165 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n156 21 CFR Ch. I (4\u20131\u201324 Edition) \u00a7 314.103 \n(b) Notification of easily correctable de-\nficiencies. FDA reviewers shall make \nevery reasonable effort to commu-nicate promptly to applicants easily correctable deficiencies found in an ap-plication or an abbreviated application when those deficiencies are discovered, particularly deficiencies concerning chemistry, manufacturing, and con-trols issues. The agency will also in-form applicants promptly of its need for more data or information or for technical changes in the application or the abbreviated application needed to facilitate the agency\u2019s review. This early communication is intended to permit applicants to correct such read-ily identified deficiencies relatively early in the review process and to sub-mit an amendment before the review period has elapsed. Such early commu-nication would not ordinarily apply to major scientific issues, which require consideration of the entire pending ap-plication or abbreviated application by agency managers as well as reviewing staff. Instead, major scientific issues will ordinarily be addressed in a com-plete response letter. \n(c) Ninety-day conference. Approxi-\nmately 90 days after the agency re-ceives the application, FDA will pro-vide applicants with an opportunity to meet with agency reviewing officials. The purpose of the meeting will be to inform applicants of the general progress and status of their applica-tions, and to advise applicants of defi-ciencies that have been identified by that time and that have not already been communicated. This meeting will be available on applications for all new chemical entities and major new indi-cations of marketed drugs. Such meet-ings will be held at the applicant\u2019s op-tion, and may be held by telephone if mutually agreed upon. Such meetings would not ordinarily be held on abbre-viated applications because they are not submitted for new chemical enti-ties or new indications. \n(d) End-of-review conference. At the \nconclusion of FDA\u2019s review of an NDA as designated by the issuance of a com-plete response letter, FDA will provide the applicant with an opportunity to meet with agency reviewing officials. The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss what further steps need to be taken by the applicant before the ap-\nplication can be approved. Requests for such meetings must be directed to the director of the division responsible for reviewing the application. \n(e) Other meetings. Other meetings be-\ntween FDA and applicants may be held, with advance notice, to discuss sci-entific, medical, and other issues that arise during the review process. Re-quests for meetings shall be directed to the director of the division responsible for reviewing the application or abbre-viated application. FDA will make every attempt to grant requests for meetings that involve important issues and that can be scheduled at mutually convenient times. However, \u2018\u2018drop-in\u2019\u2019 visits ( i.e., an unannounced and un-\nscheduled visit by a company rep-resentative) are discouraged except for urgent matters, such as to discuss an \nimportant new safety issue. \n[57 FR 17988, Apr. 28, 1992; 57 FR 29353, July \n1, 1992, as amended at 73 FR 39609, July 10, 2008] ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/314.pdf", "part_title": "APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG", "subpart_title": "FDA Action on Appli-", "section": "\u00a7 314.102 Communications between"}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 314.103 Dispute resolution.\n(a) General.

When administrative or proce-\ndural disputes arise, the applicant should first attempt to resolve the matter with the division responsible for reviewing the application or abbre-viated application, beginning with the consumer safety officer assigned to the application or abbreviated application. If resolution is not achieved, the appli-cant may raise the matter with the person designated as ombudsman, whose function shall be to investigate what has happened and to facilitate a timely and equitable resolution.

In addition, the \u2018\u2018ninety-day conference\u2019\u2019 described in \u00a7 314.102(c) will provide a timely forum for discussing and resolving, if possible, issues identified by that date. \n(2) When scientific or medical dis-\nputes arise at other times during the review process, applicants should dis-cuss the matter directly with the re-sponsible reviewing officials. If nec-essary, applicants may request a meet-ing with the appropriate reviewing offi-cials and management representatives in order to seek a resolution. Ordi-narily, such meetings would be held first with the Division Director, then with the Office Director, and finally with the Center Director if the matter is still unresolved. Requests for such meetings shall be directed to the direc-tor of the division responsible for re-viewing the application or abrreviated application. FDA will make every at-tempt to grant requests for meetings that involve important issues and that can be scheduled at mutually conven-ient times. \n(3) In requesting a meeting designed \nto resolve a scientific or medical dis-pute, applicants may suggest that FDA seek the advice of outside experts, in which case FDA may, in its discretion, invite to the meeting one or more of its advisory committee members or other consultants, as designated by the agen-cy. Applicants may also bring their own consultants. For major scientific and medical policy issues not resolved by informal meetings, FDA may refer the matter to one of its standing advi-sory committees for its consideration and recommendations. \n[50 FR 7493, Feb. 22, 1985; 50 FR 14212, Apr. 11, \n1985, as amended at 57 FR 17989, Apr. 28, 1992; 73 FR 39609, July 10, 2008] \u00a7 314.104 Drugs with potential for \nabuse. \nThe Food and Drug Administration \nwill inform the Drug Enforcement Ad-ministration under section 201(f) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801) when an application or abbreviated application is submitted for a drug that appears to have an abuse poten-tial. \n[57 FR 17989, Apr. 28, 1992] ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/314.pdf", "part_title": "APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG", "subpart_title": "FDA Action on Appli-", "section": "\u00a7 314.103 Dispute resolution."}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 314.105 Approval of an NDA and an\nANDA. \n(a) FDA will approve an NDA and \nsend the applicant an approval letter if none of the reasons in \u00a7 314.125 for re-fusing to approve the NDA applies.

While the statutory standards apply to all drugs, the many kinds of drugs that are sub-ject to the statutory standards and the wide range of uses for those drugs de-mand flexibility in applying the stand-ards. Thus FDA is required to exercise its scientific judgment to determine the kind and quantity of data and in-formation an applicant is required to provide for a particular drug to meet the statutory standards.

A predecessor in interest is an entity, e.g., a corpora-tion, that the applicant has taken over, merged with, or purchased, or from which the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of non-exclusive rights to a clinical investiga-tion after it is completed is not suffi-cient to satisfy this definition. \nEssential to approval means, with re-\ngard to an investigation, that there are no other data available that could sup-port approval of the NDA. \nNew chemical entity means a drug that \ncontains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \nNew clinical investigation means an in-\nvestigation in humans the results of which have not been relied on by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved drug product for any indication or of safety for a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation that was relied on by the agency to demonstrate the effective-ness or safety in a new patient popu-lation of a previously approved drug product.

Withdraw the applica-\ntion or abbreviated application. A deci-sion to withdraw an application or ab-breviated application is without preju-dice to a subsequent submission. \n(3) Request opportunity for hearing. \nAsk the agency to provide the appli-cant an opportunity for a hearing on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval of the ap-plication or abbreviated application under section 505(d) or (j)(4) of the act, respectively. The applicant must sub-mit the request to the Associate Direc-tor for Policy, Center for Drug Evalua-tion and Research, Food and Drug Ad-ministration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993. Within 60 days of the date of the request for an opportunity for a hearing, or within a different time period to which FDA and \nthe applicant agree, the agency will ei-ther approve the application or abbre-viated application under \u00a7 314.105, or refuse to approve the application under \u00a7 314.125 or abbreviated application under \u00a7 314.127 and give the applicant written notice of an opportunity for a hearing under \u00a7 314.200 and section 505(c)(1)(B) or (j)(5)(c) of the act on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval of the application or abbreviated application under sec-tion 505(d) or (j)(4) of the act, respec-tively. \n(c) Failure to take action. (1) An appli-\ncant agrees to extend the review period under section 505(c)(1) or (j)(5)(A) of the act until it takes any of the actions listed in paragraph (b) of this section. For an application or abbreviated ap-plication, FDA may consider an appli-cant\u2019s failure to take any of such ac-tions within 1 year after issuance of a complete response letter to be a re-quest by the applicant to withdraw the application, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit the application. FDA will grant any reasonable request for such an extension. FDA may con-sider an applicant\u2019s failure to resubmit the application within the extended time period or to request an additional extension to be a request by the appli-cant to withdraw the application. \n(2) If FDA considers an applicant\u2019s \nfailure to take action in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be a request to withdraw the applica-tion, the agency will notify the appli-cant in writing. The applicant will have 30 days from the date of the noti-fication to explain why the application should not be withdrawn and to request an extension of time in which to resub-mit the application. FDA will grant any reasonable request for an exten-sion.

The charac-teristics described in paragraph (b) of this section have been developed over a period of years and are recognized by the scientific community as the essen-tials of an adequate and well-con-trolled clinical investigation. The Food and Drug Administration considers these characteristics in determining whether an investigation is adequate and well-controlled for purposes of sec-tion 505 of the act. Reports of adequate and well-controlled investigations pro-vide the primary basis for determining whether there is \u2018\u2018substantial evi-dence\u2019\u2019 to support the claims of effec-tiveness for new drugs. Therefore, the study report should provide sufficient details of study design, conduct, and analysis to allow critical evaluation and a determination of whether the characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study are present. \n(b) An adequate and well-controlled \nstudy has the following characteristics: \n(1) There is a clear statement of the \nobjectives of the investigation and a summary of the proposed or actual methods of analysis in the protocol for the study and in the report of its re-sults. In addition, the protocol should contain a description of the proposed methods of analysis, and the study re-port should contain a description of the methods of analysis ultimately used. If the protocol does not contain a descrip-tion of the proposed methods of anal-ysis, the study report should describe how the methods used were selected. \n(2) The study uses a design that per-\nmits a valid comparison with a control to provide a quantitative assessment of drug effect. The protocol for the study and report of results should describe the study design precisely; for example, duration of treatment periods, whether treatments are parallel, sequential, or crossover, and whether the sample size is predetermined or based upon some interim analysis. Generally, the fol-lowing types of control are recognized: (i) Placebo concurrent control. The test \ndrug is compared with an inactive preparation designed to resemble the test drug as far as possible. A placebo- controlled study may include addi-tional treatment groups, such as an ac-tive treatment control or a dose-com-parison control, and usually includes randomization and blinding of patients or investigators, or both. \n(ii) Dose-comparison concurrent con-\ntrol. At least two doses of the drug are \ncompared. A dose-comparison study may include additional treatment groups, such as placebo control or ac-tive control. Dose-comparison trials usually include randomization and blinding of patients or investigators, or both. \n(iii) No treatment concurrent control. \nWhere objective measurements of effec-tiveness are available and placebo ef-fect is negligible, the test drug is com-pared with no treatment. No treatment concurrent control trials usually in-clude randomization. \n(iv) Active treatment concurrent con-\ntrol. The test drug is compared with \nknown effective therapy; for example, where the condition treated is such that administration of placebo or no treatment would be contrary to the in-terest of the patient. An active treat-ment study may include additional treatment groups, however, such as a placebo control or a dose-comparison control. Active treatment trials usu-ally include randomization and blind-ing of patients or investigators, or both. If the intent of the trial is to show similarity of the test and control drugs, the report of the study should assess the ability of the study to have detected a difference between treat-ments. Similarity of test drug and ac-tive control can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was effective. The analysis of the study should explain why the drugs should be considered effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in pre-vious placebo-controlled studies of the active control drug. \n(v) Historical control. The results of \ntreatment with the test drug are com-pared with experience historically de-rived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condi-tion, or from the results of active \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00178 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n169 Food and Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 314.127 \ntreatment, in comparable patients or \npopulations. Because historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with respect to pertinent vari-ables as can concurrent control popu-lations, historical control designs are usually reserved for special cir-cumstances. Examples include studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality (for example, certain malig-nancies) and studies in which the effect of the drug is self-evident (general an-esthetics, drug metabolism). \n(3) The method of selection of sub-\njects provides adequate assurance that they have the disease or condition being studied, or evidence of suscepti-bility and exposure to the condition against which prophylaxis is directed. \n(4) The method of assigning patients \nto treatment and control groups mini-mizes bias and is intended to assure comparability of the groups with re-spect to pertinent variables such as age, sex, severity of disease, duration of disease, and use of drugs or therapy other than the test drug. The protocol for the study and the report of its re-sults should describe how subjects were assigned to groups. Ordinarily, in a concurrently controlled study, assign-ment is by randomization, with or without stratification. \n(5) Adequate measures are taken to \nminimize bias on the part of the sub-jects, observers, and analysts of the data. The protocol and report of the study should describe the procedures used to accomplish this, such as blind-ing. \n(6) The methods of assessment of sub-\njects\u2019 response are well-defined and re-liable. The protocol for the study and the report of results should explain the variables measured, the methods of ob-servation, and criteria used to assess response. \n(7) There is an analysis of the results \nof the study adequate to assess the ef-fects of the drug. The report of the study should describe the results and the analytic methods used to evaluate them, including any appropriate statis-tical methods. The analysis should as-sess, among other things, the com-parability of test and control groups with respect to pertinent variables, and the effects of any interim data anal-yses performed. (c) The Director of the Center for \nDrug Evaluation and Research may, on the Director\u2019s own initiative or on the petition of an interested person, waive in whole or in part any of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section with re-spect to a specific clinical investiga-tion, either prior to the investigation or in the evaluation of a completed study. A petition for a waiver is re-quired to set forth clearly and con-\ncisely the specific criteria from which waiver is sought, why the criteria are not reasonably applicable to the par-ticular clinical investigation, what al-ternative procedures, if any, are to be, or have been employed, and what re-sults have been obtained. The petition is also required to state why the clin-ical investigations so conducted will yield, or have yielded, substantial evi-dence of effectiveness, notwithstanding nonconformance with the criteria for which waiver is requested. \n(d) For an investigation to be consid-\nered adequate for approval of a new drug, it is required that the test drug be standardized as to identity, strength, quality, purity, and dosage form to give significance to the results of the investigation. \n(e) Uncontrolled studies or partially \ncontrolled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval of claims of effectiveness. Such studies carefully conducted and documented, may provide corroborative support of well-controlled studies regarding effi-cacy and may yield valuable data re-garding safety of the test drug. Such studies will be considered on their mer-its in the light of the principles listed here, with the exception of the require-ment for the comparison of the treated subjects with controls. Isolated case re-ports, random experience, and reports lacking the details which permit sci-entific evaluation will not be consid-ered. \n[50 FR 7493, Feb. 22, 1985, as amended at 50 \nFR 21238, May 23, 1985; 55 FR 11580, Mar. 29, 1990; 64 FR 402, Jan. 5, 1999; 67 FR 9586, Mar. 4, 2002] ", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/314.pdf", "part_title": "APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG", "subpart_title": "FDA Action on Appli-", "section": "\u00a7 314.126 Adequate and well-controlled"}}, {"page_content": "\u00a7 314.127 Refusal to approve an ANDA.\n(a) FDA will refuse to approve an \nANDA for a new drug under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for any of the following \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00179 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n170 21 CFR Ch.

The notice will state the reasons for the action and the proposed grounds for the order. \n(1) The notice may be general (that \nis, simply summarizing in a general way the information resulting in the notice) or specific (that is, either refer-ring to specific requirements in the statute and regulations with which there is a lack of compliance, or pro-viding a detailed description and anal-ysis of the specific facts resulting in the notice). \n(2) FDA will publish the notice in the \nF\nEDERAL REGISTER and will state that \nthe applicant, and other persons sub-ject to the notice under \u00a7 310.6, who wishes to participate in a hearing, has 30 days after the date of publication of the notice to file a written notice of participation and request for hearing. The applicant, or other persons subject to the notice under \u00a7 310.6, who fails to file a written notice of participation and request for hearing within 30 days, waives the opportunity for a hearing. \n(3) It is the responsibility of every \nmanufacturer and distributor of a drug product to review every notice of op-portunity for a hearing published in the F\nEDERAL REGISTER to determine \nwhether it covers any drug product that person manufactures or distrib-utes.

Nevertheless, FDA may consider other studies on the basis of a showing by the person requesting a hearing of inadvertent omission and hardship. The person requesting a hearing shall list in the request for hearing all stud-ies in progress, the results of which the person intends later to submit in sup-port of the request for a hearing. The person shall submit under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section a copy of the complete protocol, a list of the partici-pating investigators, and a brief status report of the studies. \n(3) Any other interested person who \nis not subject to the notice of oppor-tunity for a hearing may also submit comments on the proposal to withdraw approval of the application or abbre-viated application.

Except, a person who re-quests a hearing on the refusal to ap-prove an application is not required to submit additional studies and analyses if the studies upon which the person re-lies have been submitted in the appli-cation and in the format and con-taining the summaries required under \u00a7 314.50. \n(1) If the grounds for FDA\u2019s proposed \naction concern the effectiveness of the drug, each request for hearing is re-quired to be supported only by ade-quate and well-controlled clinical stud-ies meeting all of the precise require-ments of \u00a7 314.126 and, for combination drug products, \u00a7 300.50, or by other stud-ies not meeting those requirements for which a waiver has been previously granted by FDA under \u00a7 314.126. Each person requesting a hearing shall sub-mit all adequate and well-controlled clinical studies on the drug product, in-cluding any unfavorable analyses, views, or judgments with respect to the studies. No other data, information, or \nstudies may be submitted. \n(2) The submission is required to in-\nclude a factual analysis of all the stud-ies submitted. If the grounds for FDA\u2019s proposed action concern the effective-ness of the drug, the analysis is re-quired to specify how each study ac-cords, on a point-by-point basis, with each criterion required for an adequate well-controlled clinical investigation established under \u00a7 314.126 and, if the product is a combination drug product, with each of the requirements for a combination drug established in \u00a7 300.50, or the study is required to be accompanied by an appropriate waiver previously granted by FDA. If a study concerns a drug or dosage form or con-dition of use or mode of administration other than the one in question, that fact is required to be clearly stated. Any study conducted on the final mar-keted form of the drug product is re-quired to be clearly identified. \n(3) Each person requesting a hearing \nshall submit an analysis of the data upon which the person relies, except that the required information relating either to safety or to effectiveness may be omitted if the notice of opportunity for hearing does not raise any issue with respect to that aspect of the drug; information on compliance with \u00a7 300.50 may be omitted if the drug product is not a combination drug product.

A notice of appearance and re-quest for a hearing under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is required to contain any contention that the prod-uct is not a new drug because it is gen-erally recognized as safe and effective within the meaning of section 201(p) of the act, or because it is exempt from part or all of the new drug provisions of the act under the exemption for products marketed before June 25, 1938, contained in section 201(p) of the act or under section 107(c) of the Drug \nAmendments of 1962, or for any other reason. Each contention is required to be supported by a submission under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will make an administrative deter-mination on each contention. The fail-ure of any person subject to a notice of opportunity for a hearing, including any person who manufactures or dis-tributes an identical, related, or simi-lar drug product as defined in \u00a7 310.6, to submit a notice of participation and re-quest for hearing or to raise all such contentions constitutes a waiver of any contentions not raised. \n(1) A contention that a drug product \nis generally recognized as safe and ef-fective within the meaning of section 201(p) of the act is required to be sup-ported by submission of the same quan-tity and quality of scientific evidence that is required to obtain approval of an application for the product, unless FDA has waived a requirement for ef-fectiveness (under \u00a7 314.126) or safety, or both. The submission should be in the format and with the analyses re-quired under paragraph (d) of this sec-tion. A person who fails to submit the required scientific evidence required under paragraph (d) waives the conten-tion. General recognition of safety and effectiveness shall ordinarily be based upon published studies which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. \n(2) A contention that a drug product \nis exempt from part or all of the new drug provisions of the act under the ex-emption for products marketed before June 25, 1938, contained in section 201(p) of the act, or under section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962, is re-quired to be supported by evidence of past and present quantitative for-mulas, labeling, and evidence of mar-keting. A person who makes such a contention should submit the formulas, labeling, and evidence of marketing in the following format. \nI. Formulation. \nA. A copy of each pertinent document or \nrecord to establish the exact quantitative \nformulation of the drug (both active and in-active ingredients) on the date of initial marketing of the drug. \nB.

If any such change has been \nmade, the exact date, nature, and rationale for each change in formulation, including any deletion or change in the concentration of any active ingredient and/or inactive in-gredient, should be stated, together with a copy of each pertinent document or record to establish the date and nature of each such change, including, but not limited to, the formula which resulted from each such change. If no such change has been made, a \ncopy of representative documents or records showing the formula at representative points in time should be submitted to support the statement. \nII. Labeling. A. A copy of each pertinent document or \nrecord to establish the identity of each item of written, printed, or graphic matter used as labeling on the date the drug was initially marketed. \nB. A statement whether such labeling has \nat any subsequent time been discontinued or changed in any manner. If such discontinu-ance or change has been made, the exact date, nature, and rationale for each dis-continuance or change and a copy of each pertinent document or record to establish each such discontinuance or change should be submitted, including, but not limited to, the labeling which resulted from each such discontinuance or change. If no such dis-continuance or change has been made, a copy of representative documents or records show-ing labeling at representative points in time should be submitted to support the state-ment. \nIII. Marketing. A. A copy of each pertinent document or \nrecord to establish the exact date the drug was initially marketed. \nB. A statement whether such marketing \nhas at any subsequent time been discon-tinued. If such marketing has been discon-tinued, the exact date of each such dis-continuance should be submitted, together with a copy of each pertinent document or record to establish each such date. \nIV. Verification. A statement signed by the person respon-\nsible for such submission, that all appro-priate records have been searched and to the best of that person\u2019s knowledge and belief it includes a true and accurate presentation of the facts. \n(W\nARNING : A willfully false statement is a \ncriminal offense, 18 U.S.C. 1001.) \n(3) The Food and Drug Administra-\ntion will not find a drug product, in-cluding any active ingredient, which is identical, related, or similar, as de-scribed in \u00a7 310.6, to a drug product, in-cluding any active ingredient for which an application is or at any time has been effective or deemed approved, or approved under section 505 of the act, \nto be exempt from part or all of the new drug provisions of the act. \n(4) A contention that a drug product \nis not a new drug for any other reason is required to be supported by submis-sion of the factual records, data, and information that are necessary and ap-propriate to support the contention. \n(", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/314.pdf", "part_title": "APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG", "subpart_title": "Hearing Procedures for", "section": "\u00a7 314.200 Notice of opportunity for"}}, {"page_content": " an application is or at any time has been effective or deemed approved, or approved under section 505 of the act, \nto be exempt from part or all of the new drug provisions of the act. \n(4) A contention that a drug product \nis not a new drug for any other reason is required to be supported by submis-sion of the factual records, data, and information that are necessary and ap-propriate to support the contention. \n(5) It is the responsibility of every \nperson who manufactures or distrib-utes a drug product in reliance upon a \u2018\u2018grandfather\u2019\u2019 provision of the act to maintain files that contain the data and information necessary fully to doc-\nument and support that status. \n(f) Separation of functions. Separation \nof functions commences upon receipt of a request for hearing. The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search, Food and Drug Administration, will prepare an analysis of the request and a proposed order ruling on the matter. The analysis and proposed order, the request for hearing, and any proposed order denying a hearing and response under paragraph (g) (2) or (3) of this section will be submitted to the Office of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for review and decision. When the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search recommends denial of a hearing on all issues on which a hearing is re-quested, no representative of the Cen-ter will participate or advise in the re-view and decision by the Commis-sioner. When the Center for Drug Eval-uation and Research recommends that a hearing be granted on one or more issues on which a hearing is requested, separation of functions terminates as to those issues, and representatives of the Center may participate or advise in the review and decision by the Com-missioner on those issues. The Com-missioner may modify the text of the issues, but may not deny a hearing on those issues. Separation of functions continues with respect to issues on which the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has recommended denial of a hearing. The Commissioner will neither evaluate nor rule on the Cen-ter\u2019s recommendation on such issues and such issues will not be included in the notice of hearing. Participants in the hearing may make a motion to the presiding officer for the inclusion of \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:02 Aug 19, 2024 Jkt 262075 PO 00000 Frm 00191 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\SGML\\262075.XXX 262075jspears on DSK121TN23PROD with CFR\n182 21 CFR Ch.

Fail-ure to so move constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing on such an issue. Separation of functions on all issues resumes upon issuance of a notice of hearing. The Office of the General Counsel, Department of Health and Human Services, will observe the same separation of functions. \n(g) Summary judgment. A person who \nrequests a hearing may not rely upon allegations or denials but is required to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing with re-spect to a particular drug product spec-ified in the request for hearing. \n(1) Where a specific notice of oppor-\ntunity for hearing (as defined in para-graph (a)(1) of this section) is used, the Commissioner will enter summary judgment against a person who re-quests a hearing, making findings and conclusions, denying a hearing, if it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information, and factual analyses in the request for the hearing that there is no genuine and substan-tial issue of fact which precludes the refusal to approve the application or abbreviated application or the with-drawal of approval of the application or abbreviated application; for example, no adequate and well-controlled clin-ical investigations meeting each of the precise elements of \u00a7 314.126 and, for a combination drug product, \u00a7 300.50 of this chapter, showing effectiveness have been identified. Any order enter-ing summary judgment is required to set forth the Commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions in detail and is re-quired to specify why each study sub-mitted fails to meet the requirements of the statute and regulations or why the request for hearing does not raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. \n(2) When following a general notice of \nopportunity for a hearing (as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) the Di-rector of the Center for Drug Evalua-tion and Research concludes that sum-mary judgment against a person re-questing a hearing should be consid-ered, the Director will serve upon the person requesting a hearing by reg-istered mail a proposed order denying a hearing. This person has 60 days after \nreceipt of the proposed order to re-spond with sufficient data, informa-tion, and analyses to demonstrate that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact which justifies a hearing. \n(3) When following a general or spe-\ncific notice of opportunity for a hear-ing a person requesting a hearing sub-mits data or information of a type re-quired by the statute and regulations, and the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research concludes that summary judgment against the person should be considered, the Direc-tor will serve upon the person by reg-istered mail a proposed order denying a hearing.

If FDA concludes that a drug \nproduct shown to be effective under this subpart can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, FDA will require such postmarketing re-strictions as are needed to ensure safe use of the drug product, commensurate with the specific safety concerns pre-sented by the drug product, such as: \n(i) Distribution restricted to certain \nfacilities or health care practitioners with special training or experience; \n(ii) Distribution conditioned on the \nperformance of specified medical proce-dures, including medical followup; and \n(iii) Distribution conditioned on \nspecified recordkeeping requirements. \n(3) Information to be provided to patient \nrecipients.

A donor is ineli -\ngible to donate when donating could  \nadversely affect the health of the  \ndonor, or when the safety, purity, or  \npotency of the blood or blood compo -\nnent could be affected adversely. Your  \nassessment of the donor must include  \neach of the following factors:  \n(i) Symptoms of a recent or current  \nillness;  \n(ii) Certain medical treatments or  \nmedications;  \n(iii) Travel to, or residence in, an  \narea endemic for a transfusion-trans -\nmitted infection, when such screening  \nis necessary to assure the safety, pu -\nrity, and potency of blood and blood  \ncomponents due to the risks presented  \nby donor travel and the risk of trans -\nmission of that transfusion-trans -\nmitted infection by such donors;  \n(iv) Exposure or possible exposure to  \nan accidentally or intentionally re -\nleased disease or disease agent relating  \nto a transfusion-transmitted infection,  \nif you know or suspect that such a re -\nlease has occurred;  \n(v) Pregnancy at the time of, or with -\nin 6 weeks prior to, donation;  \n(vi) Whether, in the opinion of the  \ninterviewer, the donor appears to be  \nunder the influence of any drug, alco -\nhol or for any reason does not appear  \nto be providing reliable answers to  \nmedical history questions, or if the  \ndonor says that the purpose of donat -\ning is to obtain test results for a rel -\nevant transfusion-transmitted infec -\ntion; and  \n89 Food and Drug Administration, HHS  \u00a7 630.10  \n(vii) The donor is a  \nxenotransplantation product recipient.  \n(f) How do you perform a physical as -\nsessment of the donor ?

The donor\u2019s sys -\ntolic blood pressure must not measure  \nabove 180 mm of mercury, or below 90  \nmm of mercury, and the diastolic blood  \npressure must not measure above 100  \nmm of mercury or below 50 mms of  \nmercury. A donor with measurements  \noutside these limits may be permitted  \nto donate only when the responsible  \nphysician examines the donor and de -\ntermines and documents that the  \nhealth of the donor would not be ad -\nversely affected by donating.  \n(3) Hemoglobin or hematocrit determina -\ntion. You must determine the donor\u2019s  \nhemoglobin level or hematocrit value  \nby using a sample of blood obtained by  \nfingerstick, venipuncture, or by a  \nmethod that provides equivalent re -\nsults. Blood obtained from the earlobe  \nis not acceptable.  \n(i) Allogeneic donors must have a he -\nmoglobin level or hematocrit value  \nthat is adequate to assure donor safety  \nand product potency.

Recognizing that  \nlower levels are also within normal  \nlimits for female donors, you may col -\nlect blood from female allogeneic do -\nnors who have a hemoglobin level be -\ntween 12.0 and 12.5 grams per deciliter  \nof blood, or a hematocrit value between  \n36 and 38 percent, provided that you  \nhave taken additional steps to assure  \nthat this alternative standard is ade -\nquate to ensure that the health of the  \ndonor will not be adversely affected  \ndue to the donation, in accordance  \nwith a procedure that has been found  \nacceptable for this purpose by FDA.  (B) Male allogeneic donors must have  \na hemoglobin level that is equal to or  \ngreater than 13.0 grams of hemoglobin  \nper deciliter of blood, or a hematocrit  \nvalue that is equal to or greater than  \n39 percent.  \n(ii) An autologous donor must have a  \nhemoglobin level no less than 11.0  \ngrams of hemoglobin per deciliter of  \nblood, or a hematocrit value no less  \nthan 33 percent.  \n(4) Pulse. The donor\u2019s pulse must be  \nregular and between 50 and 100 beats  \nper minute.
